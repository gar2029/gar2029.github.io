<h3 align="left"><u>CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS</u> </h3>
<p align="left">The results from this study have provided us with information on
tar per puff, nicotine per <br>puff and menthol per puff in terms of predicting
impact and menthol perceptions. It was <br>determined that each of the three
variables interact together to affect impact and menthol <br>perception and that
all three need to be taken into account when predicting impact and menthol
<br>perception for new models. For example, it was determined that relative to
nicotine per puff <br>and menthol per puff, increasing tar per puff has very
little effect on impact.
<h4><u>This <br>information suggests that in order to increase the impact of a
Merit half-nic menthol to that of <br>a regular Merit menthol, the menthol per
puff of Merit half-nic would need to be increased up to <br>about .07.
</u></h4>Since increasing the menthol per puff also increases the menthol
perception, it <br>would have to be taken into account that this increase in
menthol per puff would increase the <br>menthol perception of Merit half-nic
taking it above that of a regular Merit menthol.
<p align="left">In addition to the variables interacting together, it was also
determined from this study that <br>the interactions were more complicated at
high levels mostly because of the way the ratings <br>changed (decreasing or
decreasing and increasing); however, discussions with other persons <br>involved
with similar studies (Gullotta and Ennis) suggest that these interactions may be
real. <br>In order to get a better feel for what is going on at the high levels,
we would like to further <br>investigate the effect of tar per puff, nicotine
per puff, and menthol per puff at high levels. <br><br><br>

<h3 align="left"><u>DISCUSSION</u> </h3>
<p align="left">Although our primary interest was the acceptability ratings
ascribed to <br>the various cigarettes, however, the subjective strength and
menthol level <br>ratings also proved to be interesting -- particularly the
menthol level <br>ratings. Based upon the strength ratings, it would appear that
menthol <br>delivery may be an important determinant of subjective strength (or
smoke <br>impact) in menthol cigarettes. Supporting this notion is the fact that
<br>whenever overall significant differences in strength ratings were detected
<br>among the 5 cigarettes tested, two of the experimental cigarettes were al-
<br>ways rated significantly different from the Alpine, viz., they were rated
<br>significantly higher. These cigarettes were not both higher in nicotine
<br>delivery than Alpine -- one was but the other was not. Both cigarettes,
<br>though, were higher in menthol delivery than was Alpine. <br><br><i>{next
sentence was actually crossed out in original document} </i><br><br>And that
cigarette, of the ???????? always achieved the highest strength <br>ratings was
the cigarette which had the highest menthol delivery.<br>Obviously, nicotine is
a <br>very important determinant of subjective smoke strength (or smoke impact)
-- <br>probably much more so than menthol. But it would appear from the present
<br>investigation that the influence of menthol on subjective strength ratings
<br>over-rode the influence of nicotine. <u>This suggests that the magnitude of
<br>sensory experiences resulting from small variations in menthol delivery may
<br>be greater than there resulting from small variations in nicotine delivery.
<br>If true, this may have some practical consequences; it may be possible to
<br>increase smoke impact in low density menthol cigarettes by utilizing
somewhat <br>higher menthol delivery levels than usual. </u><br><br><br><a href="" a < 2031421329_1336.pdf pdf www.pmdocs.com http: format? in ?document></a></p></body></html>
