<h3>In general, <u>three ingredients </u>seem to have been present in the growth of each of the major
premium menthol cigarettes: KOOL, SALEM and NEWPORT.</h3>
<ul> <b>
<br wp="BR1">
<li> Younger adult smokers were responsible for most of the increased sales performance. Initial
gains came from younger adult switchers and as growth progressed gains were primarily due to
new young adult smokers. <br>
- over half of SALEM's gains from 1960-1965 came from 18-24 year old smokers. <br>
- 85% of KOOL's gains from 1964-1974 came from young adult smokers and <br>
- 90% of NEWPORT's gains since 1975 have come from younger adult smokers. <br><br>
<li> A large percentage of the younger adult switchers came from non-menthol brands. This was
true for SALEM also occurred during the growth periods of KOOL and NEWPORT as well. <br> <br>
<li> Actual product delivery and changes in product delivery in terms of menthol-tobacco balance
seems to have played a critical role in the appeal to younger adult and non-menthol smokers.
Young new smokers and younger adult non-menthol switchers seem to prefer more tobacco in
terms of tobacco-menthol balance.  Product testing studies indicated that the appeal of a menthol
brand to menthol smokers increases as the tobacco-menthol balance increases in favor of
menthol.

Other menthols same time period of the 1930s:
Snowball (Paul A. Werner, NY), Cigarette-Time (Continental, a subsidiary of Philip Morris),   Skis (Fleming-Hall Tobacco) and Menthorets (Rosedor Cigarette Co.). </p>
<br>
<p>The mentholated cigarette market sustained a relatively static two percent market share from the
late 1930s up until the early 1950s. The market remained small for many years - only Brown &
Williamson's </font>KOOL<font face="Times New Roman"> offering prize coupons along with menthol flavoring managed to achieve
any kind of values as a mentholated non-filter cigarette (12,700,000,000 units) by 1955. </p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p>SALEM<font face="Times New Roman"> - filter tip 85mm in 1959 - in the mid-fifties the popularity of filters, the long term
association of menthol with a cool refreshing taste and the growing popularity of </font>KOOL<font face="Times New Roman"> a non-filtered mentholated cigarette (mentholated cigarettes - mainly </font>Kool<font face="Times New Roman"> - represented three percent
of all cigarette sales in 1956)  prompted the introduction of </font>SALEM<font face="Times New Roman"> - the first menthol filter
cigarette in May 1956 -- by RJ Reynolds; national distribution of </font>SALEM<font face="Times New Roman"> was obtained a month
later.</font></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p>SALEM<font face="Times New Roman"> wasn't just a menthol version of </font>Winston<font face="Times New Roman">. It was a different blend with more Burley
than </font>Winston<font face="Times New Roman"> and less menthol than </font>KOOL<font face="Times New Roman">.. The available research indicated that RJ Reynolds
realized Kool was unable to gain non-menthol smokers because the menthol level was too high.
As a result, Kool was an occasional brand and most of its business was part-time usage. </p>
<p> <br>
<blockquote><p><i> Occasional (Speciality) Brand - the use of mentholated cigarettes was
initially promoted to offer an alternative to the heavy, harsh-tasting experience of some non-mentholated products. The trend was to offer mentholated cigarettes as a change-of-pace product, particularly as a "refreshment" cigarette during the winter months when lowered indoor humidity was thought to contribute to dry throats. </p> <p>
Manny Yellen, in 1964 then Vice President of Sales and Advertsing for P. Lorrilard when commenting on the menthol market indicated that Kool had a therapeutic image. Most of Kool's sales volume was done during the winter months, except in the "hot-dry" areas of the country where its sales held regularly throughout the year. </p>
<p>From a document prepared for the Chicago Tribune in 1952 on the the role and function of cigarettes it was found Kool cigarettes had a highly specific reputation. The document indicated that Kool was more of a medicine than a cigarette. Some people smoked them all the time, but they were most consistently and definitely thought of as something to change to when one has a cold, a very bad cough or a dulled palate. In a sense, they provided a way of giving up smoking without actually stopping. </i> </p></blockquote>

<br> Salem's
advertising positioned the brand as "a new idea in smoking" which had a "rich tobacco taste
with menthol fresh comfort." According to company records, the product was heavily laiden
with Burley tobacco but only slightly flavored with menthol so the tobacco taste would not be
masked.  As can be seen below SALEM's tar delivery was then higher than Kool's at the same
time its menthol level was lower. </font></p>

<br wp="BR1">
<p><font face="Times New Roman"> Its advertising was keyed to light, refreshing spring time smoking.  Refreshing as all outdoors
was the slogan. The packs were green and RJ Reynolds pushed the brand in magazines rather
than on radio because 'we wanted people to see the SALEM theme' - Grey said (not Bowman
Grey I don't think).</font></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p>SALEM<font face="Times New Roman">'s introduction was set for January 1957. To help </font>SALEM<font face="Times New Roman"> out in the crowd RJ
Reynolds wanted to sell the brand in a hard pack. The launch date and box were scrapped when
Reynolds' executives learned that Philip Morris was getting ready to sell a <a href="SPUDTextNewSpudPM1956.html"> menthol filter completely re-worked from an existing brand called </font>SPUD<font face="Times New Roman"> </a> that had limped along with little success since
1944. Reynolds went into overdrive to rush </font>SALEM<font face="Times New Roman"> out ahead of Philip Morris. RJ Reynolds'
Bill Smith, asst sales mgr. - "We didn't have the equipment for box manufacturing - we decided
to go with the soft pack. The packaging material arrived on Saturday morning and the first<sup> </sup>
</font>SALEM<font face="Times New Roman">'s were rolling out of the packing room within 24 hours."  Reynolds introduced
</font>SALEM<font face="Times New Roman"> on April 30, 1956. It went national one week later. And the reaction was phenomenal
because the only menthol brand then, was </font>KOOL <font face="Times New Roman"> but </font>SALEM<font face="Times New Roman">  had a much lighter menthol
taste and more tobacco taste and it took off like a jet. Within a year SALEM had caught </font>KOOL<font face="Times New Roman">.
By 1960 RJ Reynolds was selling 35 billion (from 4 billion in 1956)</font> SALEM<font face="Times New Roman"> and the brand had
7.5% of the market. (By 1960 - SALEM had tripled KOOL's rising sales and was largely responsible
for the menthols' 11% share of the cigarette market. ) SALEM had taken the menthol taste from
being a small speciality brand to a large successful product category.
 </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i> But even a SALEM ad in 1973 brought out the speciality role for menthol. The text - "When the weather takes a turn for the worse, your cigarette can give you a scratchy throat. If it does, turn to SALEM. SALEM's natural menthol blend tastes naturally smooth. Not harsh. Not hot. Weather or Not!" </i></p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Salem grew almost exclusively by attracting  non-menthol smokers. It also did well among
younger adult smokers during its growth and stable years. </font></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">It would take 12 years for </font>KOOL<font face="Times New Roman"> to catch up to Salem. Contributing to the decreased popularity
of SALEM was a change in product delivery.  To maintain the loyalty of its customer base  SALEM
slowly evolved into a product which had a great deal of menthol taste relative to tobacco taste.
The shift to greater menthol taste probably reduced SALEM's appeal to new smokers and younger
adult-non-menthol switchers. </font></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The shift to filter cigarettes drove a change in advertising smoking ads no longer emphasized
glamour. Instead advertising  was all about safety and enjoyment. Men in business suits were
replaced with couple smoking while enjoying a Sunday drive or an outing next to a lake or river.
</font>SALEM<font face="Times New Roman"> was perfect for the time - the Espy agency came up with another hummable winner
'You can take</font> SALEM<font face="Times New Roman"> out of the country but you can't take the country out of </font>SALEM<font face="Times New Roman">.' </font></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(RJ Reynolds - in the full flush of its success with </font>Winston<font face="Times New Roman">, launched its companion brand,
</font>SALEM<font face="Times New Roman"> - the first filter-tip menthol. It had the same size, format and packaging look as
</font>Winston<font face="Times New Roman"> but instead of the red banding </font>SALEM<font face="Times New Roman"> was done up in a chilly blue-green to suggest
its taste. Soon after its release </font>SALEM<font face="Times New Roman"> introduced high-porosity paper that its copywriters said
"breathes new mildness into the smoke..new freshness into the flavor.") </font></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">During the 1980s </font>SALEM<font face="Times New Roman"> cigarettes became more youth-oriented. Whereas the dominant theme
was "clean fresh country air," during the 1980s </font>SALEM<font face="Times New Roman"> ads were populated by muscular
surfers, beach bunnies, fun-loving party animals and other attractive adolescent role models.   </font></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In about 1963 - Bill Smith (the RJ Reynolds assistant sales manager) attended a sales management conference at Ohio State. The lecturer
was Art Cullman, a marketing professor at Ohio Sate and shared the story of</font> SALEM<font face="Times New Roman">'s
introduction as a classic example of the importance of timing in the consumer - product
business.  (Art Pullman knew something about the tobacco business. His brother Joseph Cullman
III was president of Philip Morris when </font>SPUD<font face="Times New Roman"> menthol had fizzled under the direct fire from RJ
Reynolds. (Domestic sales of </font>SPUD<font face="Times New Roman"> were discontinued in 1963.)</font></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">With the invasion of SALEM, Brown &Williamson immediately placed a filter on its regular size
</font>KOOL<font face="Times New Roman"> and put it on the market later in 1956. Although B&W had good success with its regular
(non-filter)</font> KOOL<font face="Times New Roman"> menthol it apparently had been uncertain as to the strength and direction of
the filter trend versus the non-filter king size trend for cigarettes.  As a result it offered a king
size version of its popular regular sized </font>KOOL<font face="Times New Roman"> menthol brand in 1953 instead of a filtered
version.</font></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Other entries into the mentholated king filters included Lorillard's </font>NEWPORT <font face="Times New Roman">(May) and
Liggett & Myers </font>OASIS<font face="Times New Roman"> in 1957 and in 1959 Lorillard's released</font> SPRING <font face="Times New Roman">(July</font>)<font face="Times New Roman">, Philip
Morris's </font>ALPINE<font face="Times New Roman"> and American Tobacco came out with Riviera.
<br wp="BR1">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">By the end of 1958 mentholated brands accounted for about one of every six filter cigarettes and
one of very 12 cigarettes of all types.</font></p>
<br> <p>
In 1960 Brown & Williamson
added </font>BELAIR<font face="Times New Roman">, despite the fact that </font>KOOL<font face="Times New Roman">  filter was doing well. By 1962 king menthol filters
had risen to 15% of the cigarette market. American Tobacco Company in May 1964 released
<img align="right" height="120" width="80" src="MontclairMentholFilter.jpg">
</font>MONTCLAIR <font face="Times New Roman">- this was what amounted to a mentholated version of </font>CARLTON<font face="Times New Roman">, which had
an "air-vent" filter that was to further cool the smoke.  Robert B. Walker (because president of
American Tobacco in 1963) hoped </font>MONTCLAIR<font face="Times New Roman"> would take some of the play away from
Salem and Kool but this brand failed to gain more than a modest foothold. It's interesting to note that MONTCLAIR had the menthol placed in the filter and not mixed in with the tobacco.  </font></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p>SPRING<font face="Times New Roman"> (the air-conditioned cigarette) -  added to Brown & Williamson's arsenal even though
it would compete with </font>NEWPORT<font face="Times New Roman">. This cigarette featured a Lorillard first - a Lorillard
developed cigarette paper - "electronically treated to create uniform ventilation over the surface
of the cigarette via hundreds of microscopic openings which take in fresh air and allow heat (but
not smoke or flavor) to escape." </font>SPRING<font face="Times New Roman"> (contained a "wisp of menthol" for a cool, light taste)
presented in a white soft pack, banded with blue and green stripes, also featured a special blend
of tobaccos and a new "honeycomb" filter composed of a maze-like fiber network providing a
myriad of filtering smoke baffles. </font></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<img align="left" height="120" width="80" src="NewportPack1957.jpg">
<p>NEWPORT <font face="Times New Roman">- filter tip 80 and 85mm in 1959 (Lorillard) -    Probably  where the </font>NEWPORT<font face="Times New Roman">
cigarette got its name - Newport Jazz Festival - held annually from 1954 - one of the oldest jazz
festivals organized in Newport, RI by Louis Lorillard and Elaine Lorillard who administered it
through a non-profit corporation. According to Lorillard, </font>NEWPORT<font face="Times New Roman"> had an imaginative hint of
mint that swept to an immediate success among smokers who wanted only a touch of menthol
with more tobacco taste than offered by other mentholated brands, thus enlarging the so-called
"menthol" market.   </font></p>

<p>ALPINE<font face="Times New Roman"> - Philip Morris brought out </font>ALPINE<font face="Times New Roman"> in 1959 to replace its old </font>SPUD<font face="Times New Roman"> menthol that was
then discontinued  nationally in 1963. The packaging mimicked the </font>Marlboro<font face="Times New Roman"> design, only in
green instead of red and with a snowy mountain peak instead of the peaked roof. </font>ALPINE<font face="Times New Roman"> began

<h3>Since 1962,  mentholated counterparts (line-extensions, hitchhiking) of brand release have been
taken for granted. In almost every case, when a new brand is currently released, there is a
mentholated version developed and released as well to capture that segment of the smokers which
prefer this taste mixed with its tobacco.</h3>
