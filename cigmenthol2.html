<p align=left>  Menthol has been used for years in cough and cold
remedies that carry warnings - in case a cough or congestion
persists, consult your doctor. Such persistent symptoms may be signs of
more serious conditions. However, no warning for menthol use is found
on cigarette packs since the FDA can't regulate tobacco products.
<p align=left>
Most of menthol's effects on the respiratory tract are because of
stimulation of cold receptors producing a "cool sensation," and menthol
cigarettes indeed do contain enough menthol to produce that sensation --
however, the "cool sensation" may be covering up disease such as cancer. ( http://www.cancer.org/tobacco/quitting.html )

Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer in both men and
women, accounting for 28% of all cancer deaths. Since 1987, more women
have died each year of lung cancer than breast cancer. More than 90%
of lung cancers are preventable. The overwhelming majority of lung
cancers, greater than 90% are caused by cigarette smoking.
<p align=left>
African American (AA) men are at least 50% more likely to develop lung
cancer than Caucasian men. These AA men have a higher mortality rate
of lung cancer (100.8 per 100,000) than Caucasian men (70.1 per
100,000). About 3 out of 4 AA smoke mentholated
cigarettes and among youth, 9 out of 10 smoke menthols. For white
smokers, about 1 out of 4 smoke mentholated cigarettes.

81% of African American men who smoke and have contracted lung cancer
die from the disease, compared with 54% of their white counterparts.

**** Is is very likely that smoking menthols masks the early warning
signs of lung cancer, causing people to delay seeking medical attention
until it's too late. **** Further, a comment we received recently from
a physician indicates the above is a real possibility -- his words:
<u> "You
are absolutely right -- you would think this is common
medical knowledge."
</u>
<p align=left>
Well, it is NOT common knowledge and something has to be done to prevent
this increase in deaths from lung cancer --- that is one of the missions
of this GoodHealth website...
