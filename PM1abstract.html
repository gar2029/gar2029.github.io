 <p><i>Background</i>: continual use of
  cold preparations including those containing menthol for relief from
  congestion, cough, or difficulty in breathing can mask the early warning
  symptoms of respiratory dysfunction. These products usually carry a warning label
  on the packaging that indicates that they are not for continuous use and may
  mask the early warning symptoms of a more serious condition. Menthol can be
  delivered in many dosage forms including the smoke of a mentholated cigarette.
</p>
  <p><i>Methods</i>: Literature searches
  were done for the NLM databases (e.g., MEDLINE from 1966, TOXLINE, OLDMEDLINE
  (1958â€“1965), CANCERLIT), plus tobacco industry documents and hardcopy
  indices. The evidence was evaluated with application to mentholated cigarette
  smoking.</p>
  <p> <i>Results and Discussion</i>: A logical progression
  is presented to attempt to demonstrate that the continuous smoking of
  mentholated cigarettes may also mask the early warning symptoms of
  respiratory distress. The early warning symptoms caused by chronic irritation
  of the respiratory tract may be reduced in severity when the menthol found in
  a mentholated cigarette is continually delivered to the tract.</p>
 <p>  <i>Conclusion</i>:
  This masking of the symptoms of an underlying respiratory
  disease can lead to delays in seeking medical attention resulting in a poor
  prognosis, additional suffering, and eventual death.</p>
