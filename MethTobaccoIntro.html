October 3, 2006 A highly concentrated chemical in cigarette smoke, acrolein,
alters genes and may be an important cause of lung cancer, according to a study 
to appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Researchers
at the New York University School of Medicine in Tuxedo found acrolein 
mutated DNA and hindered cells trying to repair genetic damage. Acrolein
is 1,000 times more prevalent than other chemicals in cigarette smoke 
believed to cause cancer, the study said. The findings increase understanding 
of how smoking causes lung cancer and could be used to help make cigarettes safer,
the researchers said. (by Kevin Orland, Bloomberg.com, korland@bloomberg.net)
It's intertesting to note that Thomas Edison felt that acrolein was the injurious 
agent in cigarettes - he wrote Henry Ford:Orange, N.J.,April 26, 1914,Friend Ford 
- The injurious agent in cigarettes comes principally from the burning paper 
wrapper.The substance thereby formed, is called "Acrolein." It has a violent
action on the nerve centers, producing degeneration of the cells of the brain,
which is quite rapid among boys.Unlike most narcotics this degeneration is
permanent and uncontrollable. I employ no person who smokes cigarettes.

October 3, 2006 - Altria Group Inc.'s Philip Morris USA and other U.S. cigarette 
makers lost their bid to delay enforcement of a racketeering decision the 
companies claim may cost them hundreds of millions of dollars. U.S. District 
Judge Gladys Kessler in Washington today refused to delay the decision while 
the cigarette makers appeal. She ruled Aug. 17 that the companies violated
the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, in a case
filed in 1999 by the U.S. Department of Justice. (by Joel Rosenblatt,

OCTOBER 1, 2006 - International sports events including the Formula One Grand Prix
 will today lose their exemption from an Australian ban on tobacco advertising
 and sponsorship, the government said. The Australian government had given the 
Formula One Grand Prix, Motorcycle Grand Prix and three other events six years 
to find alternative sponsors. Both the grand prix events still had tobacco 
sponsorship yesterday, the government said in a statement. Formula One is the 
last major sport to allow cigarette ads. The European Union banned tobacco 
sports sponsorship and advertising last year. Companies including Japan Tobacco 
Inc., Imperial Tobacco Group Plc and British American Tobacco Plc have pulled
 out of Formula One sponsorship deals in the past year. ``Sporting events 
such as the Australian Grand Prix can no longer carry tobacco advertising,'' 
Christopher Pyne, parliamentary secretary to the health minister, said in
 the government's statement. ``We set the October 2006 deadline to allow
 sufficient time for organizers to negotiate alternative sponsorship 
arrangements.'' The three other events whose exemptions also ended today
 -- the Ladies Masters Golf, the Indy 300 and Rally Australia -- have all 
found alternative sponsors, according to the government. To contact the

SEPTEMBER 28, 2006 -RJR ramping up weekend production Winston-Salem Journal,
Richard Carver, reporter -About 80 percent of production employees at R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co. will be working mandatory overtime on weekends for
several weeks to help overcome a major cigarette shortage, the manufacturer
said. In particular - shortages of Doral, Monarch, Vantage 
and Winston. Shortages started because of a packaging supply problem. 
SEPTEMBER 26, 2006 - Light Cigarettes Suit Could Extract a Heavy Price on
Tobacco Companies  - Contrary to what tobacco companies had hoped for,
U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein in Brooklyn, N.Y. made a pre-trial
ruling yesterday allowing as  many as 50 million light cigarette smokers
to claim class-action status in a lawsuit against the country's major
tobacco companies. Also included in this ruling in a 2004 lawsuit was
an allegation that Philip Morris USA [now Altria] (MO), Reynolds American
Inc.'s (RAI) R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., and Loews Corp.'s (LTR) Lorillard
Tobacco unit lied to consumers by advertising "light" cigarettes as being
healthier than the regular high-tar version. The plaintiffs are seeking 
between $120 billion and $200 billion in damages, the approximate amount 
that the tobacco companies  gained through their alleged deception. 
As a result, Altria announced it would delay its planned breakup and spinoff
of its 88%-owned Kraft division. Altria's stock went down $5.26, or 6.4%,
to $77.06. Reynolds shares fell $2.27, or 3.7%, to $59.75. Tobacco companies
are appealing the ruing in  the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York.

Hospital found one-third of attention deficit hyperactivity cases are 
linked to prenatal exposures to cigarette smoke or childhood exposures
to lead (Los Angeeles Times).
SEPTEMBER 7, 2006 -
Also contributing to Marlboro’s success is the performance of Marlboro 
Menthol.  The menthol segment has been growing for several years and 
Marlboro Menthol has shared in this growth.  Marlboro Menthol’s share
is up 1.2 share points over the last three years while the menthol
segment has increased by one share point.  During this time, Marlboro
has grown its share of the menthol segment from 12% to 16.1% and is 
now the number two menthol brand behind Newport.  This year,
Marlboro Menthol has benefited from enhanced packaging and retail
merchandising. With Marlboro Menthol and other offerings, Marlboro
has remained true to its heritage and its flavor proposition while 
offering a portfolio of products that meet the tastes of adult smokers.

JULY 28, 2006 - According to the results of a population-based study
patients diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (refers to several
different types of cancer that originate within the immune system) who
are heavy smokers and large consumers of alcohol appear to have a worse 
survival than those who do not drink or smoke tobacco heavily. 
(Battaglioli T et al., Cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption as
determinants of survival in non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma: a population-based
study, Annals of Oncology 17:1283-1289, 2006) Previous studies have 
indicated that smoking tobacco may increase the risk of developing
non-Hogdkin's lymphoma. 
JULY 11, 2006 - Governor Mike Easley of NC signed a bill into law on 
Monday (7/10/06) that bans smoking in legislative buildings. The smoking 
ban covers the main areas where state legislative business takes place.
Until now, visitors to the Legislative Building and the Legislative Office 
Building could regularly spot lawmakers, lobbyists, reporters and others
puffing away in meetings and the hallways. NO MORE. The News & Observer -

JULY 9, 2006 - The FDA has approved Pfizer's anti-smoking drug Champix 
(varenicline).Champix is unique because it is specifically designed to
partially activate nicotinic receptors and reduce the severity of the
smoker's craving and the withdrawal symptoms from nicotine. The drug is
said to nearly double the probability of long term cessation in patients.

JULY 1, 2006 - UK raises age limit to buy cigarettes to 18. Health ministers 
are to ban the sale of tobacco to 16- and 17-year olds from 2007, changing 
a law that was put in place 70 years ago. It will mean that from 2007, a 
17-year old will be old enough in law to drive, fight in Iraq, have sex and
get married - but too young to vote or buy alcohol or cigarettes. (Tobacco

JUNE 28, 2006 - The risk of leukemia in childhood appears to be increased 
when fathers smoke, even if the smoking occurs before conception and with 
exposure to smoking after birth. Study author: Dr. Jeffrey S. Chang, 
University of California, Berkeley - based on 16 cases and 8 controls. June issue
of American Journal of Epidemiology. (Reuters UK)
JUNE 20, 2006 - A study in the journal Thorax online finds that smokers with
a lot of wrinkles are far more likely to have lung damage than smokers with
less-lined faces. Heavily wrinkled smokers were 5 times more likely as other 
smokers to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 149 current and 
former smokers who had smoked at least one pack of cigarettes a day for 5 years
were looked at.  (The News & Observer, Raleigh)     
JUNE 14, 2006 - the North Carolina Senate Health Committee unanimously
approved a bill to ban smoking within General Assembly buildings, as 
lawmakers in the nation's leading tobacco-producing state (300 million 
pounds per year, 70% of all the flue-cured tobacco grown in the nation) 
crack tobacco smoking. Senate and House members have both outlawed 
smoking within their chambers over the last 3-years but a handful 
of legislators and observers are still allowed to enjoy a smoke in 
other corridors and rooms. The General Assembly has previously banned
smoking in public museums, libraries, prisons and public health centers.

JUNE 12, 2006 - Marriott at City Center (Newport News, Virginia) will be
totally a smoke-free environment. On Thursday, June 15, 2006, the 
full-service hotel and conference center opens as the only one that is 
100% smoke free. Comments from Bruce Smith, General Manager, "Properties

JUNE 10, 2006 - Some anti-smoking groups and tobacco companies are calling
for the European Union to relax its ban on a form of oral smokeless tobacco
called "snus". Widely used in Sweden, snus is moist tobacco which is placed under
the lip. It comes in pouches resembling minature tea bags and releases nicotine 
into the bloodstream through the gums. Since Sweden and Norway enforced smoking 
bans in public places, sales of snus has soared. It has become increasingly 
popular among some smokers who use it to wean themselves off cigarettes. But 
scientists around the world remain divided about how dangerous snus really is.
Snus is available in various flavors such as lemon, coffee, cranberry and mint.
(A Safer Alternative To Smoking? by Daniel Cooke, BBC) See below May 3, 2006 -
Philip Morris will be test marketing a spit free smokeless tobacco called Taboka
starting in July 2006. This product seems similar to snus discussed above. 
JUNE 8, 2006 - Tobacco giants test smoke-free products. Mark Smith of RJ Reynolds
indicates, "we're just responding to meeting consumer demand. Smoking bans are 
making it more difficult for adult smokers to enjoy a tobacco product." Camel Snus
(pronounced snoose - same name as Swedish product - see June 10, 2006 above) went 
on sale this week in convenience stores in Portland, OR and Austin, TX. Users tuck
the tobacco pouch into their cheek but don't spit or chew. Reynolds sells the 
product in 15-pouch tins. Philip Morris's product Taboka (see May 3, 2006 below) 
which will be test marketed in Indianapolis in July comes in a 12-pouch pack 
and costs about the same as a pack of Marlboro. (USA Today, by Wendy Koch)     
MAY 30, 2006 - Supreme Court Agrees to hear the Philip Morris case with $80 million
in damages. The Supreme Court said today that it will decide if PM must pay these
damages to a long time smoker (janitor who smoked 3-packs of Marlboro a day before
he died in 1997 of lung cancer, started smoking in the 1950s while serving in the 
Army in Korea), A CASE THAT COULD SHIELD COMPANIES FROM LARGE JURY AWARDS. The 
Oregon Supreme Court had ruled that the amount was not excessive given the 
"extraordinary reprehensible" conduct of PM in marketing cigarettes. ARGUMENTS 
WILL BE HEARD IN THE FALL - 2006. (The Associated Press)     
MAY 27, 2006 - Children (irrespective of gender, ethnicity and economic status
- aged 11 to 16 years)who smoke just one or two cigarettes in their childhood
are more likely to be hooked to the habit later in life, according to a new study
by researchers at the University College London found in the July issue of 
Tobacco Control. This is the 1st time that a period of 'dormant vulnerability'     
has been shown, whereby smoking a single cigarette can leave children 
susceptible to smoking uptake for several years (the sleeper effect).

MAY 23, 2006 - Cigarette maker Reynolds American said on Tuesday (May 23, 2006)
it had received antitrust approval from the US Federal Trade Commission for its
$3.5 billion purchase of Conwood, then number 2 player in the smokeless tobacco 
industry. (Tobaccojournal.com, May 26, 2006)Conwood is the only company to 
compete in 5 segments of the US smokeless tobacco industry, manufacturing moist
and dry snuff, and loose leaf, plug and twist chewing tobacco. Moist snuff 
accounts for more than 70% of sales, led by both its premium-priced Kodiak brand
and its rapidly growing valued-priced Grizzly brand. The leader is United States
Smokeless Tobacco makers of Skoal and Copenhagen. (Reynolds American holds products

MAY 3, 2006 - Philip Morris USA is set to test market (starting in July 2006) a
spit-free smokeless tobacco called Taboka in Indianopolis, IN. The product is 
marketed toward smokers who want to find alternatives to cigarettes. The 
spit-free feature was designed to help attract those who find the traditional 
smokeless tobacco unappealing or unacceptable. (Taboka Tobaccopaks will come

MARCH 23, 2006 - Youth Smoking rates on the decline yet big tobacco still 
raking in big bucks. Even though U.S. youth smoking rates are on the decline, 
tobacco companies are still raking in big bucks from youth smokers, and in 
fact, their profits are increasing. According to a new report in the April 
issue of the journal Tobacco Control, in 1997 U.S. youth smoked 890 million 
packs of cigarettes, which amounted to $737 million in revenue for the
tobacco industry. However in 2000, youth cigarette smoking levels dropped to
541 million packs of cigarettes, yet revenue for Big Tobacco jumped to $1.2 
billion as a result of an increase in the wholesale price of cigarettes. 
(All Headline News)   
MARCH 8, 2006 - Cigarette sales fall sharpely in 2005 according to the National 
Assoc of Attorneys General Tobacco Commitee. The group cites figures compiled
by the Tobacco Tax Bureau of the US Dept. of Treasury showing that sales in 2005
declined by 4.2% from 2004 levels - marking the largest one-year decrease since 
1999. The 378 billion cigarettes sold in the US in 2005 represented the lowest
number of cigarettes sold in the US since 1951 - the US population has more than
doubled in size since then. There has been an 8-year decline in cigarette sales
of 21% since the tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, 1998. (Consumeraffaairs.com)  
MARCH 3, 2006 - Puerto Rico Governor Anibal Vila signed a bill that makes
Puerto Rico the 13th United States state/district/territory to go smokefree, 
joining California, Delaware, New York, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, 
Rhode Island, Montana, Vermont, Wasington, New Jersey and the District of 
Columbia. The law eliminates tobacco smoke in bars, casinos and other 
workplaces, as well as in private cars with children under 13 years old aboard.

JANUARY 27, 2006 - California became the first state to declare second-hand 
smoke (passive smoke) a toxic pollutant citing its link with breast cancer. The
decision by the Caliofornia Air Resources Board puts environmental tobacco smoke
in the same category as diesel exhausts, arsenic and benzene. Experts said the 
decision may have more impact worldwide than if does in the largely smoke-free
state. Scientists at the Califronia Office of Environmental Health blamed 
second-hand for 4000 deaths each year in California from lung cancer and heart
disease. (MSNBC New Service, 1/27/2006).     
OCTOBER 18, 2005 - California has become the 3rd US state to require tobacco 
companies to meet standards for self-extinguishing cigarettes. These cigarettes
are made with special paper designed to stop the cigarette from burning if it is
not actively smoked. Approximately 25% of fires are caused by cigarettes. New 
York and Vermont have encated similar legislation. (Winston-Salem Journal)   
JUNE 1, 2005 - There's a disturbing gap in the smoking rates of Black and White
Chicagoans, according to a study released in the June issue of the American
Journal of Public Health, and it's...true mentholated cigarettes contain the 
most nicotine and are almost entirely marketed to the Black community," said
Steve Whitman, director of the Sinai Urban Health Institute. According to the
report, "Smoking in Six Diverse Chicago Communities - A Population Study," 
smoking rates in predominately Black neighborhoods were doubled that of whites.
Also a 2002 report from San Doego State University states that African Americans
facing day-to-day racial discrimination in employment, housing and health 
services are more likely to use cigarette smoking as a means of coping with 
their stress --- "47,000 African Americans die annually because of smoking, or
'nicodemon,' as we call it," says K. Ron Harris of the National African 
American Tobacco Prevention Network. Lawsuits...claimed the 2004 "Kool MIXX" 
promotion, billed as a "celebration" of Hip Hop music and culture, violated 
the 1998 national tobacco Master Settlement Agreement by targeting African 
American youth [handing out cigarettes]. RJR agreed to pay $1.46 million for 
youth smoking prevention programs. "The tour...began May 13 in Boston...held in
14 cities...we check ID's and give [cigarettes]...to people who show they're 
already smokers," said rep Craig Fishel. "...It's a subtle kind of 
institutional racism," said Chicago native TripleBlak, a nationally known

DECEMBER 14, 2004 - Tobacco lobby and its influence in American politics.. In 
the 106 Congress, Republicans voted pro-tobacco over 3-times as often as

DECEMBER 12, 2004 - Altria's Group Inc.'s Philip Morris USA division is raising 
its cigarette prices by cutting promotions by 10 cents on Marlboro, Basic,
Parliament and Virginia Slims after the discounts hurt earnings the past
2-years. Philip Morris USA started the 65-cents discount in late 2002 to lure
back smokers who switched to lower-price makers. The average price of a Marlboro
last quarter was $3.60 a pack in convenience store, $1.14 higher than the most
deeply discounted cigarettes. Philip Morris USA's discounts helped top-selling
Marlboro gain market share, but eroded profits by 24%. During the 3rd quarter
that ended in September, discounts helped Marlboro add 1.1% to Philip Morris
market share, lifting it to 49.9%. Marlboro's share rose 1.5% points to 39.6%
from the 3rd quarter of 2003. Cigarette makers are raising prices and cutting
discounts Congress mandated they pay $9.7 billion to buy out tobacco farmers

DECEMBER 08, 2004 - Cigarette makers have revved up price promotions in recent,
years, a strategy they know will lead to more underage smoking, states an
economist testifying in the US government's racketeering trial against the 
industry. Frank Chaloupka, an economist at the Univeristy of Illinois, told a
federal judge that spending on cigarette price promotions had soared in recent
years and that the industry has long known discounts are especially attractive
to teenagers. Statistics compiled by the FTC show that the 6-largest cigarette
manufacturers spent more than $7.8 billion on price discounts to retailers and 
wholesalers in 2002. Spending on the discounts and other promotional allowances
now makes up the biggest portion of the industry's advertising and promotional
budgets. Between 2001 and 2002 it more than doubled to $9.66 billion, according
to figures compiled by the FTC. (Tobacco Journal International Online

judge has for a second time awarded damages to Lorillard Tobacco Company after 
ruling that a Chicago-area gas station was selling counterfeit versions of 
Lorillard's cigarettes. Judge Holderman awarded $250,000 to Greensboro, NC
Lorillard after finding that S&M; Central Service Corp. knowingly distributed
counterfeit cigarettes bearing Lorillard's brand names. (S&M; sells consumer 
products and operates service bays in Chicago location.)  In September, an 
Illinois District Court fined distributor Canstar USA $2.5 million for a similar

OCTOBER 30, 2004 - Allowing Tobacco Industry to Kill 400,000 Americans per year
.... U.S House Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas)has stated, "our founding fathers, many
of them grew tobacco. If they knew we were trying to regulate one of the first
cash crops that made our nation independent, I don't think they would appreciate
 that." Barton is the Chairman of the House Commitee on Energy and Commerce has
the power to assure anti-tobacco bills are never considered and thus "die
 in-committee". Barton's defense of tobacco along with Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison's support of the tobacco industry has lowered Texas to the morbid 
status as the leading Tobacco State. (Letters to the Editor North Texas e-News,
 Leonard Jensen)
OCTOBER 7, 2004 - Attorneys Generals from Illinois, New York and Maryland on 
Wednesday (10/6/2004) announced a settlement with R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. 
(Reynolds bought Brown & Williamson in July 2004 - see news brief below)that
prohibited the inclusion of hip-hop songs on the CD-ROM with other restraints.
The settlement also bans the use of "Kool," "Mixx" or "House of Menthol" on any 
merchandise; prohibits the sale of "special edition" packs in retail stores
and prohibits the "House of Menthol" website.  R.J. Reynolds can still use some
hip-hop marketing under the settlement. It can still, e.g., host DJ contests,
but it must hold them in adult-only activities and cannot broadcast them.
Reynolds signed the settlement without admitting wrongdoing. (Let's hope the 
money is used for its attended purpose - GHS) Kwesi Ronald Harris, Director of
Prevention Programs at Bobby E. Wright Behavorial Health Center will receive a
portion of this money to fund youth prevention programs. (Chicago Business,

to a more competitive menthol cigarette market. According to a Smith Barney

Kool - "Smooth Fusion")in place through the end of 2004, while working to have 
a new strategy in place at the start of the year. (R.J. Reynolds' profits up in

Williamson conceded that the special edition boxes of Kool were a mistake and
discontinued them. (Chicago Sun Times, suntimes.com, Chery V. Jackson, staff 
reporter) 
JULY 25, 2004 - Critics say cigarettes still aimed at teens - just more slyly
now. Salem's (RJ Reynolds) "stir the senses" ad campaign and Kool's (Brown and
Williamson) "Smooth Fusion" campaign ads cigarete makers claim only appear in 
publications whre 80% of the readers are 18 or over. Health groups say that the
ads target teens and minorities. Tobacco companies abandonment of the youth 
market are undermined by Kool when Kool releases a line of cigarettes with 
flavors like Midnight Berry and Carribean Chill (also Mocha Taboo - Kool has 
16-styles (GHS). Again, tobacco makers claim those flavors are aimed at adult
who like flavors. Their research tells them that adults have gone to flavors
as part of a market trend, e.g., you have lemon and cherry vodka.
