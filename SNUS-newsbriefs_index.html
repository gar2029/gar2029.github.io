that their menthols must sells at the same price and RJR insists that Kool sell at 10 cents less.<br><br>
This one store has an agreement with RJR that no pack of cigarettes can sell for less than Doral at $2.99.

July 13, 2008 - North Carolina (NC) lawmakers wonder why so many kids are not graduating high school?? 
Governor Easley, in his last year in office, released his recommended state budget 
adjustments for the 2008-2009 fiscal year, which would have increased tax on cigarettes and alcohol. 
The increase in the cigarette tax from 35 cents per pack (7th lowest in U.S.) to 55 cents (12th lowest in U.S.)
would have 
 started on September 1, 2008 so that about $100 million could be generated to help pay for 
a proposed average 7-percent increase for teachers and to boost the state's 
struggling effort to reform its mental health care system.
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#071707a" ">
It turned out to be a "win-win" situation for the state the last time NC raised 
taxes on cigarettes (in mid-2006) cigarette sales fell but revenues from the additional tax increased.</a>
North Carolina educators still make less than the national average. 
State tobacco control people chimed in that the increase in 
the cigarette tax proposed by Easley should be much higher. 
But legislative leaders did not have much of an appetite to raise taxes or fees in an election year.
Some argue the increase in the cigarette tax would be unfair to the poor in the state
but this is the exact group the increase in taxes is targeting. It's a know fact that with the 
increase in cost of cigarettes will result in kids deciding not to use tobacco and smokers more likely to quit. 
In this <a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#061508">difficult economic times</a> there's 
even a greater chance the smoker would want to 
quit and put the money saved in doing a better job providing for his(her) family.
The final budget called for about a 3% increase for teachers. During negotiations Easley 
accused legislative of seeking to "shaft" public school teachers in favor 
of a tax cut benefiting the wealthy. <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/politics/story/1125065.html">

July 12, 2008 -  Studios reached an agreement yesterday to place anti-smoking ads on new movie DVDs (rated
G, PG or PG-13).. 
According to the deal reached between Sony Pictures, Universal Studios, Warner Bros.,
 Paramount Pictures, Walt Disney Studios and Twentieth Century Fox,
 the anti-smoking announcement will be introduced 
in the opening minutes of DVDs of all new movies with smoking scenes. 
Dan Glickman, chief executive of the Motion Picture Association of America, 
said the industry’s intention was to notify parents “about smoking depictions in films so they can make 
informed decisions.”

July 11, 2008 - Canadian: a  bill introduced to snuff out drive to recruit young smokers.. 
MP Judy Wasylycia-Leis, from Winnipeg North a member for the New Democratic Part has proposed
legislation to strengthen Canada's tobacco laws and to protect young
Canadians from new and dangerous novelty tobacco products.  The bill would amend the federal Tobacco Act
and curb the marketing of cigarillos.   In recent years, candy-flavored cigarillos and other novelty tobacco
products have become a significant threat to Canadian youth. <font size="4" style="Background-color:orange">Health
Canada data released at the end of May shows that sales of cigarillos
have grown by over 300% per year between 2001 and 2006, from fewer than
50,000 units to over 80 million.</font> 
The legislation closes loopholes by:
requiring that cigarillos be sold in the same size packages as
cigarettes, requiring cigarillos to carry the same type of health
warnings as cigarettes, banning the use of candy, liquor and other
flavorings and banning the sale of 'blunts', another novelty tobacco product.
The Canadian Coalition for Action on Tobacco is national coalition of
health organizations are strongly back and aspect speedy passage of this bill.

July 10, 2008 - Smoking ban starts in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya (a member of the 
<a href="FCTCgen.html">
FCTC</a>) - they may be
 serious this time.. 
As of Wednesday, July 10, 2008 people who smoke in public in Nairobi face a fine or 
up to six months in jail. Kenya's government has already implemented such bans in 
Mombasa and the Rift Valley town of Nakuru, saying it wants to cut the harmful effects of secondhand smoke.
 The authorities say some 8,000 Kenyans die every year from smoking.  
Nairobi town clerk John Gakuo told a news conference 
first-time offenders will either be 
fined 2,000 shillings (about $30) or be jailed for six months. 
Repeat offenders face a bigger fine or up to nine months in prison. 
Small local pubs would be exempted, Gakuo said, but restaurants must
 provide separate smoking areas if they want to let their customers light up.
Last year a Kenyan court suspended a smoking ban ordered by the Health Ministry
 after it was challenged by the Kenyan unit of British American Tobacco Plc 
(majority local market share, about 80% of the legitimate cigarette trade)
and a local manufacturer (probably Mastermind Tobacco Limited - TW).
The two companies estimated that they would lose more than $10 million each if the legislation was enforced.
 The new law bans the sale of cigarettes to people under 18 years and selling tobacco 
in a packet of less than 10 cigarettes. It also forbids promoting tobacco by sponsoring sports,
 cultural, educational or entertainment activities 
and branding of buildings other than those owned or leased by manufacturers.
Smoking earns the Kenyan government about five billion shillings (76 million dollars or 49 million euro)
 a year in taxes, but costs five times as 
much in disease, disability and death, according to official figures.
On 13th June 2008, the Finance Ministers of Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania simultaneously read their 
2008/2009 budget speeches to their respective nations. Each budget of these three East African countries
proposed to increase excise duties on cigarettes. (<a href="http://blogsofbainbridge.typepad.com/jackie/kenya/index.html">

to the group's most recent NATO E-News bulletin, this effort involved mailing 
a personalized letter to more than 7,100 state legislators and all 50 state governors warning

 than the estimated amount of additional revenue.
or collected far less than the estimated amount of additional revenue.

Cigarettes, bras and Bull semen: Just a few things the US exports to Iran..
Despite increasingly tough rhetoric toward Iran, which Bush has called part of an "axis of evil,"
the value of U.S. exports
 to Iran has reportedly increased tenfold since George Bush took office. While there are
reportedly strict rules about what the U.S. can ship over there, they apparently aren't too 
limited--US tobacco companies have reportedly exported $158 million worth of cigarettes to the nation

Iran about $12.6 million worth of bull semen and at least $101,000 worth of bras.

Chief Executive Hiroshi Kimura of Japan Tobacco, the world's third-largest cigarette maker and half-owned by the 
Japanese government, stated in a Reuters interview that most Japanese smokers would quit if the 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#061608b">
price of cigarettes 
 were to triple</a>, as could happen under a proposed tax scheme.
Kimura: "If prices reached 1,000 yen ($9.34) a pack (e.g., 
<a href="Mild_Seven_2.jpg">
Mild Seven</a>, the most popular cigarette in 
Japan at present costs 300 yen ($2.80), 80 to 90 percent of smokers would quit and 
the rest would probably cut back."
The company has already seen costs rise even as it grapples with a 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#042408a">
declining domestic market</a>,
where the population is shrinking and consumers are becoming more health-conscious, 
resulting in a market that has contracted for nine straight years.
The company's overseas tobacco business more than doubled its operating profit 
to 205.3 billion yen in the past year, while profit from its 
domestic operations slipped 9 percent to 222 billion yen as the market shrank for a ninth straight year.
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#042007c">Japan Tobacco last year acquired Britain's Gallaher Group for about $15 billion 
to vastly increase its international sales.</a>
Kimura said his company hoped to expand into Asia to take advantage of its huge 
population, with expansion into India, Indonesia and China being considered, but did not give details.

July 7, 2008 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Massachusetts cigarette tax jumps $1 per pack..</font>
 Governor Deval Patrick signed the bill Tuesday,
July 1, 2008, a day after House (approved by a 93-52 vote) and Senate (approved by a 26-9 vote) lawmakers rushed 
to approve the bill by the start of the new fiscal year. The increase brings 
Massachusetts' cigarette tax to $2.51 per pack. New York has the highest cigarette tax in the nation 
at $2.75 per pack.
Supporters say the tax increase would help raise $174 million in revenues. They say the extra money
 will go to help cover the cost of the state's landmark health care law. Vermont's cigarette tax rate 
climbs by 20 cents to $1.99 per pack effective Tuesday, a jump that follows a 60-cents-per-pack increase in 2006.
New Hampshire's cigarette tax, now $1.08 per pack, is slated to jump to $1.33 in October if it doesn't
,  generate at least $48 million in revenues between July 2008 and October 2008.

Abstract</a>. 
The researchers sought to quantify the risk of smokeless tobacco after a number of studies differed
on just how dangerous the products were. An assessment of eleven studies worldwide concluded that 
smokeless tobacco products (STP) lead to an 80% increase 
in risk of oral cancer, a 60% increase in risk of esophageal cancer, and a 60% increase 
in risk of pancreatic cancer. There also seem to be geographic differences in how these 
specific cancers are related to STP use. More than 50% of oral cancers in India 
and Sudan can be attributed to STPs specific to those countries, compared to only 4% 
of oral cancers in the USA. Sweden can blame 20% of esophageal and pancreatic cancer 
on STPs that are consumed there. Research from the USA suggests an 80% increase in 
lung cancer risk for STP users. One study found that men that quit smoking and switched to 
spit tobacco had about a 2.5 times increase risk 
of death from oral cavity and pharynx cancers than those who stopped using tobacco completely. 
According to the authors, there is strong support from animal studies and research on cancer 
mechanisms that indicates an increase in cancer risk due to STPs. It was concluded that getting cigarette
users to switch to STPs was not good public policy. 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#041908">More on SNUS use and untoward experiences.</a>   
It should be remembered hat the number of studies on smokeless tobacco is relatively slight compared 
to the wealth of literature
published relating to smoking. (Marita Broadstock, NZHTA Report, volume 10 Number 1, February 2007)

July 3, 2008 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">South Carolina (SC) will
 NOT devote any resources to anti-smoking programs..</font> The bill passed
 to raise the lowest-in-the-nation 7-cent cigarette tax by 50 cents
was vetoed by Governor Sanford. The SC House fell some 20 votes
 of the two-third needed to override a veto by the governor. The bill if passed
 would have generated an estimated $159 million, of this $5 million would have been used for smoking
 prevention and cessation programs. Then in June 2008, lawmakers cut the $2 million the state
 was investing in anti-smoking efforts; so, as of now (7/3/2008), the state will spend no money on these programs.
This is unfortunate since even the governor was for the tax increase on cigarettes. Governor Sanford, "We've
 been calling for an increase to the cigarette tax for five years, but the question has always
 been what happens to the money." The governor wanted to use the money collected to be used for tax relief for SC
citizens. He was concerned the rise in the cigarette tax if used  to  grow the medicaid benefit would result
 in fewer people smoking which could eventually result in a financial shortfall for the state. Sanford 
didn't realize the increase would save the state money because fewer kids, teens and adults would be smoking. 
Kelly Davis, an anti-tobacco advocate, had it right but she was a little late - she noted  if lawmakers 
cannot agree
 on how to spend this money then raise the tax and decide later on how to spend it.

<a href="http://pingmag.jp/2008/06/16/vending-machine-extravaganza">Japan is the land of the vending

the sale of tobacco to anyone under the legal age. 
In a country where there are more than half a million cigarette vending machines, 
the legal implications of this new law are severe. The vending machines will employ an 
advanced facial recognition system that compares a buyer's bone structure, skin sag, brow 
wrinkles and crow's feet against a record 
of more than 100,000 people. If the buyer fails the visual scan, they will be required to insert their 
ID card into the machine in order to verify that they are of legal age to smoke. 
The new vending machines come at a time when tobacco companies are facing increased
scrutiny from both the general public and the Japanese government. The card system was
 first introduced in Miyazaki and Kagoshima 
<a href="http://www.japan-guide.com/list/e1002.html">
prefectures</a> in March 2008 gradually spread across the nation. It is expected, with the use of this new system, 
that teenage smoking will drop rapidly.A recent study showed that 14% of boys and 4% of girls aged 17 and 18 smoke every day in Japan.

July 1, 2008 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Black Lawmakers Want to Limit
Use of on Menthol Cigarettes..</font> The 43-member congressional Black Caucus is calling for 
changes to a House tobacco-regulation bill
(Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act), demanding that the legislation place restrictions 
on menthol cigarettes, <a href="MentholCig.jpg">
<img src="MentholCig.jpg" width="50" height="50"></a> the type heavily favored by 75% of African-American smokers.
The caucus is taking aim at a provision in the bill that would ban candy-, 
fruit- and spice-flavored cigarettes but that specifically exempts menthol. In recent weeks
the exemption has become the focus of controversy because menthol brands are heavily used by black smokers, 
who develop a large share of smoking-related cancers and other health risks.
On the other side of the debate, Lorillard, the cigarette company that would stand to lose
 the most from a ban on menthol, is mounting a counteroffensive. In e-mail messages sent on
 June 22, 2008 to smokers of its leading menthol brand, Newport,
 the company urged them to call their Congressional representatives.
The legislation has passed crucial committees in both the House and the Senate,
 and supporters are hoping for floor votes this year.

 For example, Philip Morris appears to be prepared if Marlboro Snus Spice, for which a trademark is pending,

Priority Mail, which is often used for shipping tobacco, is sealed against inspection. Therefore 
a federal search warrant or consent would be needed to open these packages. Unless the mailer
 voluntarily discloses that a package contains nonmailable matter, generally the only way to determine whether 
it contains unlawful contents is to open the package. We are aware that proposed legislation would 
make tobacco nonmailable. If Congress is to pursue this path, we recommend that nonmailability language 
be included in Title 18,which contains the criminal law statutes,

Copenhagen and the value/priced (discount) Husky brand.
Skoal has been rolling out various new brands MST including mild flavors like Citrus Skoal- designed to both 
convert smokers and add new younger consumers to its base. Its winery division grew 25% on extremely
ust high volume last quarter.
In an April 2008 article on MSN Money USSTC president Daniel W. Butler said:
 This marked the seventh consecutive quarter of premium volume growth. I am especially
 pleased to see that despite a challenging economy and new price value entrants, premium volume 
trends remain strong and there has not been an acceleration in the price value segment.
In fact, that’s not entirely true. Low priced smokeless tobacco has been gobbling up 
market share from UST for several quarters now, as this RealMoney.com article points out:
   UST has had significant losses in market share to rivals like No. 2 player Conwood,
 a unit of Reynolds American , which is focused on the price-value segment with its 
low-cost Grizzly brand. Ten years ago, UST owned more than 80% of the smokeless tobacco market.
 By late 2004, the company's market share had slipped to 68%. Today, it's less than 60% and trending down.
And the trend has no reason to break, yet. Sure, there is ALWAYS brand loyalty.
I’d be naïve to doubt that. But, if we are in a recession, you can bet that the 
discount dip will creep its way up the income brackets
 <a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#043008">Reynolds American first quarter 2008 profit was disappointing..</a>

June 19, 2008 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Philip Morris International (PMI) 
urging South Africa Members of Parliament (MPs)
to change the 'Tobacco Products Control Amendment Bill'..</font>
PMI wants a change in the definitions of advertising and promotion, arguing that the present 
wording would prevent legitimate communication within the industry. The bill, which is before Parliament,
 aims to place greater restrictions on the advertising, promotion and sponsorship of tobacco products.
It includes all commercial communication or action brought to the notice of any member of the public 
in the definition of advertisement, and says promotion includes the practice of fostering awareness 
of positive attitudes towards a tobacco product or manufacturer for the purposes of selling.
If strictly interpreted, a phone call, a price list or a job advertisement would have tobacco companies
 falling foul of the law, Philip Morris spokesman Neetesh Ramjee told MPs.
He called for the bill to be amended to include a definition for the Marlboro cigarettes trade
and for this group to be exempted from the advertising and promotion restrictions.
PMI also called for changes to the bill's controls of point of sale advertising.
The existing laws say signs for tobacco products must be placed within 1m of a point of sale.
 The signs are allowed to show price and availability, and must carry health and minimum age warnings.
 The bill proposes limiting such advertisements to a single sign at the point of sale.
A single notice for all tobacco products would prejudice new market entrants and well-established 
firms an unfair advantage, said Steen Hjortholm, Philip Morris southern and east Africa manager.
Philip Morris disinvested from SA in the 1980s, and only began selling its Marlboro cigarettes products
 here again in 2004. It has about 5% of the market, and faces stiff competition from British American
Tobacco and Japanese Tobacco International. Each tobacco company should be allowed one sign at point of sale that would list its brands
 and the price of the products, said Hjortholm.

June 18, 2008 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Egypt's fledgling anti-tobacco program 
to place images and warnings on cigarette packs.. </font>
Starting Aug. 1, 2008 cigarette labels in Egypt will be required to carry images of the effects of smoking: 
a dying man in 
an oxygen mask, a coughing child, and a limp cigarette symbolizing impotence.
Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health's Center for Communication Programs 
is helping Egypt with the campaign.
For the new label requirements, authorities field-tested a variety of images.
They found that warnings linking tobacco with death were not particularly effective with Egyptians, since 
dying is perceived as inevitable anyway. Also, images of diseased lungs left 
people confused about what was being shown. Instead, the new warnings focus on threats to health and, particularly, to family, 
like the effect on children and pregnant women and the risk of impotence.
The campaign faces a tough challenge among Egypt's die-hard smokers.
Egyptians suck down an estimated 50 billion cigarettes a year, which according to the World Bank 
makes it the largest tobacco consumer in the Middle East and North Africa, accounting
 for nearly one fourth of total consumption in the region and the 17th-biggest tobacco market in the world.
By law, the Eastern Company the state-owned cigarette-maker monopoly is the only company
 allowed to produce cigarettes in Egypt.

June 18, 2008 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">If you want a safe, smoke-free environment
 for your children it's best to quit smoking..</font>
An Australian study (K. Rumchev et al., How free of tobacco smoke are 'smoke-free' homes?, Indoor Air: 18(3):
202-208, June 2008) suggests that levels of respirable suspended particles, including nicotine,
 were significantly higher in houses where smokers 
lived than in smoke-free homes - even if they only smoked outside. 
Researchers measured nicotine and respirable particles over 24 hours in the living rooms of 92
 Perth households with children aged between four and nine years old. Although 39 houses (42%) had 
smokers, only 4% said smoking occurred inside. Levels were low in homes without smokers and
 considerably higher in houses where smoking was reported.
Half of the children in the study had lower respiratory symptoms, such as asthma, wheezing 
and shortness of breath, while 42% had upper 
respiratory symptoms, including coughing and runny nose.
Respiratory illness was more prevalent in households with smokers than smoke-free homes. Children exposed 
to higher air nicotine levels were three times more likely to have asthma or wheeze than those not exposed.
It is interesting to note that <a href="
http://www.healthinsite.gov.au/topics/Asthma_Statistics">the prevalence of asthma in Australia 
is among the highest in the world:
 between 14% and 16% of children and between 10% and 12% of adults have asthma.</a>

Menthol brands are chosen by about 75% of African-American smokers, 
a group with a disproportionate share of smoking-related cancers. 
That special protection for menthol has been considered crucial to getting 
the nation's biggest cigarette maker, Philip Morris USA, to support the legislation,

June 16, 2008 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">British considering banning logos 
on cigarette packs, other measures..</font>
British Government's Dept of Health has released a consultation paper entitled, The Future of Tobacco Control to 
trigger a 12-week national debate. The proposals would ban cigarette companies from putting 
any kind of logo or branding onto their cigarette packets. Cigarette manufacturers 
would have to sell cigarettes in plain black-and-white boxes
 with nothing but health warnings written on them. The paper also suggests 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#053108b">
restricting the display 
of tobacco products in shops, possibly by requiring they are placed under the counter</a>, banning cigarette vending
 machines and stopping the sale of cheaper packs of 10 cigarettes instead of the usual 20. 
Further, it suggests banning advertising of rolling papers and other smoking paraphernalia.
<a href="Brit_Dept_Health_Dawn_Primarolo.jpg">
Dawn Primarolo</a>, the public health minister, said: "Protecting children from smoking 
is a government priority and taking away temptation is one way to do this. If banning 
brightly colored packets, removing cigarettes from display and removing the cheap option 
of a pack of 10 helps save lives, then
 that is what we should do—but we want to hear everyone's views first."

June 16, 2008 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Japanese lawmakers want to triple cigarette prices..
</font>
 At present, Tokyo is a city with the world's
most affordable cigarettes. Taxes currently account for 189 yen ($1.75)of the price of a 300 yen ($2.77)packet 
in Japan. Lawmakers have proposed raising taxes for Japan's cigarettes to fund rising welfare costs in a country 
where smoking kills about 100,000 people a year. Japan Tobacco Inc. (JT) controls more than 70% of the cigarette
 market in a country where about 40% of the male population smokes. A state-owned monopoly
 until 1985, the Japanese Finance Ministry now owns half of the company. 
JT says the proposal would devastate the nation's tobacco industry and could hurt the
share price of the world's third-largest publicly traded cigarette maker.   
Japan Tobacco is the world's #3 tobacco firm, trailing railing Altria and British American Tobacco. 
Japan Tobacco also operates in the foods, pharmaceuticals, agribusiness, engineering, and real estate
 industries.

June 10, 2008 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Decline in Cigarette Sales 
Offset by Use of Other Tobacco Products (OTP)..</font> 
Research Letter: Trends in the Use of Cigarettes and OTP, 2000-2007, G. Connolly and H. Alpert, 
J. Amer. Med. Assoc. 299(22): 2629-2630, 2008. Between 2000 and 2007 
 cigarette sales in the U.S. declined 18 percent, from 21.1 billion packs to 17.4 billion packs. Over that 
same period, sales of OTP increased by the equivalent of 1.10 billion packs of cigarettes --
 714 million moist snuff, 256 million roll-your-own tobacco, and 130 million small cigars. This use of 
 OTP offset the decline in cigarette sales by 30 percent. Cost is one reason for the upsurge in the 
use of non-cigarette tobacco products. Cigars, roll-your-own and smokeless tobacco products are generally 
priced lower than cigarettes. State and federal cigarette taxation polices appear to have been
 effective in reducing smoking, but small cigars and roll-your-own tobacco are taxed at 5 percent to 
10 percent the rate of cigarettes, resulting in prices much less than an equivalent pack of cigarettes.
Cigarette companies are responding to the changing pattern of consumption by entering other tobacco markets, 
including acquisition of major U.S. moist snuff manufacturer Conwood by R J Reynolds,
 and by marketing new snuff and snus (moist tobacco powder placed under the upper lip) products 
to attract new smokers and new tobacco users. The lower taxes and fewer indoor restrictions on 
snuff and other products may help explain the trend,
 underscoring the need for similar taxes on all tobacco products, Connolly emphasized.

A couple comments from Swedes on snus. (1)Anne of Anne's Foods, Stockholm, Sweden - I'd say flavored snus 
is actually 
really traditional,
 people have been flavoring their tobacco for ages here. It's part of the tradition - and these
 snus flavors that we were presented with are definitely old and not something new and fancy.
 In fact, I don't think we have many heavily flavored kinds - 
some though, mostly marketed towards women. 
(2)The fact that people in Sweden consume such vast amount
 of snus says something about the level of culture in this country. For me the habit is repulsive 
and I am glad I don’t have to kiss a woman who uses it. It is in par with the 
consumption of surströmming, i.e. rotten fish. (Goran Hansson - Blog Skaneland)

will formally spin off its entire interest in 
Lorillard Inc. to the Carolina Group in a tax-free transaction that will make Lorillard a publicly

 will be traded as LO on the New York Stock Exchange as of June 10. 
UBS tobacco analyst Nik Modi says, "With menthol capturing greater market share in the 
premium cigarette business–paced by Newport as well as more recent investments by Philip Morris USA and Reynolds American–the spinoff should make 
Lorillard even more formidable." Modi added that Newport's top share in menthol comes even though
 it is the least promoted brand among the mainstream 
cigarette brands and carries the highest price point in the segment. (In Raleigh, NC in the last couple weeks
Newport has gone up a $1.00/carton - TM)   <a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#032008a">Lorillard has a Snus

 June 1, 2009..</font> <a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#041608d">All Nebraska workplaces</a>,
 including restaurants, bars and gaming facilities, will be smoke-free, thanks to legislation 
overwhelmingly approved by the Legislature
 and signed into law by Governor Dave Heineman (February 2008). Many cities in Nebraska already have smoking bans.
Lincoln and Omaha have their own public indoor smoking ordinances, covering roughly half of the state’s
 residents. Lincoln’s ban prohibits smoking in all bars and restaurants, while Omaha’s ban has been more controversial 
because it prohibits smoking only in bars that serve food and do not offer keno.
Ron Asher of North Platte, representing the Nebraska Medical Association, said health 
care costs for smoking-related illnesses in the state have grown to $1.2 billion. 
Much of it is paid for by the nonsmoking majority of the population, he said.
The City of North Platte City Council (May 20, 2008) passed an ordinance prohibiting smoking in all city facilities. 
No smoking is allowed within 25-feet of any city facility or 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#052708b">
inside any city park.</a> 
Those who do and get caught could get fined up to $1,000.

June 1, 2008 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">South Carolina - Tobacco Tax Increase Killed - State
 House Fails to Override Governor's Veto.. </font>
The plan to raise the state's lowest-in-the-nation cigarette tax from 7-cent per pack 
to 57 cents was defeated 54-57 Tuesday (May 27, 2008) when the House fell some 20 votes
 of the two-third needed to override a veto by Gov. Mark Sanford.
The plan would have generated an estimated $159 million but lawmakers can't agree on how the money should be 
spent. Governor Sanford, "We've been calling for an increase to the cigarette tax for five years, but the question
 has always been what happens to the money." Advocates for raising the tax stated that the bigger issue: a higher 
tax means fewer kids, teens and adults smoking and a healthier state. The group's spokeswomen, Kelly Davis, noted if
lawmakers cannot agree on how to spend this money then raise the tax and decide later.

 her quit two years ago. "I felt like I had leprosy. After a while you end up outside smoking by yourself. 
So many people don't smoke now." </i>
Employers are hesitant to employ tobacco users and if employed, 
smokers have to contribute more toward health insurance. People don't want smokers in their homes or around their children.

growth. Waiters and bartenders have also benefited.
Tests showed noticeable 
improvements in their lung function after only a few months.  Now 
<a href="scotland_RtR_Robison.jpg">
Public Health Minister Shona Robison</a> announced
 an action plan to the Scottish Parliament, which also includes tobacco
 licensing and outlawing the sale of cigarettes in packs of 10. A major part of this plan is the banning of all
tobacco dipslays. Ms Robison told the Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSP): "Despite tobacco advertising 
having been banned in 2002, there are growing concerns that prominent displays of cigarettes and other tobacco products in 
shops and other points of sale are undermining our wider tobacco control efforts to denormalise smoking." She told 
MSP similar moves in other countries had not seen a dramatic impact on businesses. Ms. Robison, "The protection
 of children and young people from the impact of tobacco must be paramount and there are instances -
and this is one - when the benefits to the public health of the nation must take precedence." 
His legislation is likely to be brought forward in 2009.

NEJM 357(4):370-379, 2007</a>)

 a similar pattern with smoking cessation.  Not surprisingly, the greatest influence was seen
 in close relationships. When a spouse stops smoking, the other partner is 
67 percent less likely to smoke. Similarly, when a friend quits, the odds of the
 other continuing drops by 36 percent. The odds are similar 
among co-workers and siblings.
 The findings back up previous studies showing that peer influence plays a key role 
in people's decision to stop lighting up and provide evidence that the "buddy system" used
 by smoking cessation, weight loss and alcoholism programs to change addictive behavior works.

 100 million people in India smoke bidi (beedi) and more people die 
due to smoking bidis than all other forms of tobacco combined, says a bidi monograph, the first study 
of the kind conducted anywhere in the world. for every cigarette, eight bidis are sold in India. 
And what's worse, nearly 2.3% children, 
aged 13-15 years, have taken to it. While 19 per cent of tobacco consumption in 
India is in the form of cigarettes, 53 per cent is smoked as bidis. 
At present, 800,000 people die due to tobacco consumption in India,
 among whom 600,000 should be due to bidis alone."  Bidi may contain lesser tobacco than cigarettes — 0.2 grams,
 but delivers as much 
or more tar and nicotine. 
The monograph, 'Bidi and Public Health' authored jointly by Dr
 P C Gupta from Healis Sekhsaria Institute for Public Health and Dr Samira Asma from Centres for Disease 
Control and Prevention (Atlanta), in partnership with
the health ministry, WHO and US Department of Health and Human Services.

May 16, 2008 – <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Tobacco Tax Increase – 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#012108a">
What’s Wrong with South Carolina??</a></font> South Carolina's (SC) cigarette 
tax is currently 7 cents, the lowest in the nation. It was last raised 31 years ago. On Tuesday, May 6, 2008
the State Senate gave approval to as 50-cent per pack increase in the state’s cigarette tax. The tax is expected 
to collect $159 million yearly. According to the 
<a href="SC_Tobacco_Collaborative.jpg">
S.C. Tobacco Collaborative</a>, which represents health groups
 raising cigarette tax to 57 cents will prevent 35,500 SC kids who are alive today 
from becoming smokers. In addition, 18,700 adults will quit or won't start smoking. With such positive 
health benefits that can result from the increase in the cigarette tax why does the 
<a href="Mark_Sanford_SC_Governor_2008.gif">
Governor Mark Sanford</a>
say that he will veto the Senate's cigarette tax hike.  
Of the $158 million that is expected to be collected $76.5 million will be used to enlarge and grow Medicaid 
benefits. Based on current 
Medicaid growth numbers of eight percent annually, $165.2 million will be needed to provide that same 
level of benefits 10 years from now. The governor is concerned that the raise in the cigarette tax will 
result in fewer smokers which could result in a financial shortfall in the future in paying for Medicaid. (As we know 
some states where the tobacco tax has been increased have actually seen an increase in taxes raised; e.g.,
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#040408b">Iowa</a>, <a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#071707a">North Carolina</a>  
but other 
states have seen a decrease, e.g., <a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#042108a">Wisconsin</a>.) Governor Sanford agrees with the idea of raising the cigarette tax but would like
 the money collected to be used to provide tax relief to South Carolinians. Instead of circumventing 
the governor's veto the groups wanting passage 
of the bill should work with the governor to obtain agreement on how the money raised should be spent.
One non-negotiable item should be the $5 million needed to pay for efforts to prevent smoking 
or getting people to quit. References: <a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2008/05/06/ap4977598.html">

May 15, 2008 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Protect Our Children - Make it illegal to use the U.S. 
Postal Service to deliver any form of tobacco product..</font> The 
congressional legislation sponsored by Rep. John McHugh, R-N.Y., entitled the "Do Not Mail Tobacco Bill" (H.R. 2932) 
would amend Title 39 of the United States Code, restricting the USPS from delivering certain 
tobacco products. The bill provides that cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and 
roll-your-own-tobacco are nonmailable matter, would not be carried or delivered by mail and would be 
disposed of as the Postal Service directs. It also imposes a penalty of $100,000 for each violation.
The bill would add tobacco to the list of items banned from mail delivery and as a result would block Internet 
sales of cigarettes to minors and those seeking to evade paying state taxes.
The Connecticut Attorney General Richard  
Blumenthal believes that Internet sellers of tax-free cigarettes would go out of business if they could not
 rely upon the Postal Service for delivery. UPS, FedEX and DHL have signed agreements with state attorneys
 general that they will not deliver tobacco products — but not the Postal Service. Mary Anne Gibbons, general counsel
 for the Postal Service, said that the Postal Service has taken action to reduce the ability of tobacco retailers to use the
 mail for illicit sales but acknowledged that their existing authority is limited.
The bill cleared the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee by a voice vote earlier
this month (May 2008) and now awaits a floor vote in the House of Representatives.

<font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Public health experts are questioning why menthol flavoring in cigarettes, received  
special protection as Congress tries to regulate tobacco for the first time..</font></a> Menthol is the most widely used 
 cigarette flavoring and the most
popular cigarette choice of African-American smokers. While fewer people are smoking, menthols'
 share of the overall cigarette market has grown steadily for several years.
In 2000 about 26.5% of smokers were menthol smokers, in 2006 you're looking at 28.5% - menthols are approaching 30% 
of the $70 billion
American cigarette market.
The latest version of the bill released in July 2007 clove joined menthol as the only additives allowed in tobacco. An earlier 
version of the legislation released in February 2007 included cloves in a list of artificial or natural
 flavors like strawberry, chocolate and cocoa that would be banned from cigarettes largely because they 
had been used to appeal to children. 
On May 13, 2008 an individual with intimate knowledge of the process that led to the FDA tobacco legislation 
(Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act) 
that is currently
before Congress has admitted, for the first time, that the <font size="4" style="Background-color:red">legislation
represents the results of a negotiation

May 10, 2008 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">SAN FRANCISCO Ban on 
tobacco at drug stores sought..</font> San Francisco would become the first city in the United States to ban the
 sale of tobacco in pharmacies if legislation introduced by Mayor Gavin Newsom is approved. The proposed law 
is designed to curb tobacco sales at stores  where 
pharmacists work, but would not apply to big box businesses such as Costco or to grocery stores.
The ordinance is just one of a series of measures supported by the mayor intended to promote healthy living
 among San Francisco residents, said Newsom spokeswoman Giselle Barry. "The spirit of this is that 
pharmacies (considered public health centers) are places people go to get better," she said.
 "They shouldn't be selling products that cause cancer." The legislation would take effect on Oct. 1, 2008 
if the Board of Supervisors approves it. The Department of Public Health, which already regulates tobacco sales in
 San Francisco, would enforce the law. Violators would face fines of $100 to $1,000.
 Mitch Katz, the Public Health Department Director, said it is a “conflict of interest” for pharmacies 
to sell tobacco products. In some cases, he said, people go to the stores to buy medication
 to treat health complications brought on by smoking. Katz said the ban could reduce smoking 
as it creates another restriction that sends the message “smoking is bad.” Walgreens spokesman Michael Polzin
 said the “biggest concern” about the proposed ban is how it would impact the sales of other products.
Michael Negrete, CEO of the Pharmacy Foundation of California, said a business promoting health should 
not “sell things that are hazardous to health.”

Hookahs on college campuses becoming growing public health issue..</font></a> Researchers at Virginia Commonwealth 
University have found that more and more U.S. college students are smoking tobacco using waterpipes 
(hookah, sheesha, shisha, narghile).
The findings provide important insight into the prevalence and perceptions related to 
<a href="waterpipe_illustration_mechnaism.jpg">
waterpipe tobacco smokers</a>.
In a cross-sectional study, approximately 744 students, mostly between the ages of 18 and 21, completed an Internet 
survey that included questions about demographics, tobacco use, risk perceptions and perceived social acceptability.
Researchers found that approximately 43 percent of those surveyed had smoked tobacco using a waterpipe 
in the past year and 20 percent of them had smoked tobacco using a waterpipe in the past month. They also found 
that users were more likely to perceive waterpipes as less harmful than cigarettes as compared to those
 who had never used a waterpipe before. (Eissenberg, et al., Waterpipe Tobacco Smoking on a U.S. College 
Campus: Prevalence and Correlates, J Adolescent Health 42(5): 526-529, 2008) 
<br><br>
Principal investigator 
Thomas Eissenberg, Ph.D. said that
 current and prospective waterpipe tobacco smokers
 should be made aware that the method is not as benign as they might think.
Waterpipe and cigarette smoke contains some of the same toxins — disease-causing 
tar and carbon monoxide, as well as dependence-producing nicotine.
Besides this, the exposure to these toxins through waterpipe smoking may be greater 
due to longer periods of use. Also, smokers take more and larger puffs with waterpipes, leading to inhalation
of 100 times more smoke from a single waterpipe use episode relative to a single cigarette. 
Eissenberg concluded that, "prevention messages, especially those that communicate the potential risks of waterpipe
 tobacco smoking, should focus on college campuses.” <a href="http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/washington/news.aspx?id=88493">

 nicotine-free snus like product, may cause cavities..</font></a>
In 2006 the firm launched in pouches the tobacco-free snus like product, Onico  in Sweden, the world's biggest snuff market per capita.
Freddi Lewin, health advisor at Swedish Match (Svenska Tandsticks), said the company had been contacted by two dentists 
in the past month saying patients using the product
 had developed cavities, and also by consumers with similar concerns.  Swedish Match sells about 500,000 cans 
of Onico per month at about 18 crowns  ($2.99USD) per can, versus about 15 million cans of
 regular snus monthly in Sweden, a company spokesman said. A Swedish dental journal, <a href="#">
<u>Tandlakartidningen</u></a>, said 
it had received reports from around the country of cavities in connection with the use of tobacco-free snus.
It is possible that the corn fiber in Onico may be transformed into sugar and as a result causes dental cavities.

May 6, 2008 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">World Asthma Awareness Day..</font>
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease that makes airways (bronchial tubes)
 particularly sensitive to irritants, and this is characterized by difficulty in breathing.
Globally, the prevalence of asthma continues to escalate with more than 300 million sufferers around the world. 
 In many countries the annual asthma death toll rises year in, year out.
 In the United States, an estimated 23.2 million people currently suffer from asthma,
 almost 9 million of whom are under the age of 18 - that's 12 percent of all children.  Asthma 
is the leading chronic illness of children in the United States 
and the leading cause of school absenteeism due to chronic illness.  It causes almost 
500,000 hospitalizations and about 5,000 deaths annually. 
Asthma affects people of all ages, it often starts in childhood and is more common in children than adults. 
 More boys have asthma than girls, but in adulthood, more women have asthma than men. Although asthma 
is a problem among all races, blacks have more asthma 
attacks and are more likely than whites to be hospitalized for asthma attacks or to die from asthma.<br><br>
<font size="4">Tobacco smoke can be a powerful asthma trigger setting off an asthmatic attack with the person unable to breath.
Even children who don't have asthma are at risk of problems if their parents smoke. These kids are
 more likely to get upper respiratory 
infections and develop lung conditions, including asthma. We can assume that all parents that bring a child 
into the world want the best for their child. If you have to smoke do not smoke in the 
<a href="asthma_boy2.jpg">

May 2, 2008 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Three of the four largest U.S. cigarette makers 
are no longer a smart investment..</font> 
Stocks of cigarette makers were long thought of as recession safe havens. Shares of three have
 declined more sharply than the S&P; 500 index since the start of the year of 2008. While the benchmark index has
 fallen nearly 6 percent, Altria Group  Inc., the largest U.S. cigarette maker, slipped 14 percent,
 Reynolds American (RA) dropped 18 percent, and Loews  Carolina Group fell 23 percent. The financial results for 
the first quarter were so bad that RA has already reduced their full year forecast. It used to be 
that smokers were unlikely to cut back on their habit even in an economic slowdown.
 But analysts point to bans on smoking in restaurants, bars and other public places that have been 
enacted since the last recession. Standard & Poor's last week said volumes of U.S. cigarette shipments this year
 should fall 3.5 percent, compared with a prior estimate of 2.7 percent. S&P; believes shipment numbers will continue 
falling as a result of the smoking bans and higher cigarette prices. If Congress hikes the federal excise tax to $1 a pack,
 shipments could drop even further. 
<br><br>
Entry into the smokeless tobacco arena expected to shore up the losses from decreases
 in cigarette sales have not worked out. 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#041308a">
Altria thought based on Marlboro brand strength</a> they could roll out
a Marlboro Snus and then Marlboro MST (that was suppose to compete with old reliables like Skoal and Copenhagen in the premium 
moist snuff segment) with immediate success. It hasn't happened for these products and the other smokeless products
now being tested by RA and Loews. At one time we thought an acquisition would be needed for Altria to succeed in the smokeless arena. 
It was rumored that Altria would acquire either 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#020508">UST</a> or <a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#020408">Swedish Match</a>
but is this enough?? Cigarettes sales (2005) bring in around $82 billion a year while smokeless 
tobacco per year brings in $3.7 billion. It looks like at least in the USA the tobacco control folks are winning.

 in the May 6 issue of the J Am Coll Cardiol, 51:1760-1771, 2008; 51:1760-1771. Study author Christian Heiss, MD,

 exposed to a half hour of secondhand smoke at levels commonly found in public smoking areas. The study
 participants also underwent similar evaluations after exposure to smoke-free air on a different day.
It was learned that in healthy nonsmokers, even brief exposure to secondhand smoke resulted in
blood vessel dysfunction and interfered with the activity of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which are believed 
to play a key role in repairing blood vessels. The damage to the EPCs appeared to last as long as a day.

 profit disappointing..</font>
 RAI posted weaker-than-expected first-quarter
 profit on Wednesday (4/30/2008) due to declines in sales of 
cigarette brands on which it focuses less marketing (non-growth brands) and pressure from competitors amid the weak U.S. economy.
The maker of Camel cigarettes and Grizzly smokeless tobacco also cut its full-year profit forecast, citing 
the challenging economic environment. Its shares fell as much as 8 percent to a two-year low.
"The guidance downgrade ... is due to an increasingly competitive environment in cigarette and smokeless," 
JP Morgan analyst Erik Bloomquist wrote in a research note.  Reynolds Chief Executive Susan Ivey said the 
company was disappointed in the results and the
 performance of R.J. Reynolds but added that it faced a number of challenges.
"We are ... continuing to see shifts between tobacco products and categories," she told analysts on a 
conference call, citing growth in such products as little cigars, roll-your-own cigarettes and moist snuff.
The tough economy has not led many people to quit smoking, but it has resulted in more demand for deep-discount
 cigarettes and lower-priced products, Ivey said. Growth brands - Camel, Kool and Pall Mall – posted a combined 
share gain of 0.5
percentage points from the prior-year period, with a first-quarter share of 13.2 percent. That
performance was driven by continued growth of Camel and Pall Mall, and a slight decline on
Kool. <font size="4">
Camel Snus, R.J. Reynolds’ first effort to broaden Camel’s appeal beyond cigarettes, is on
track for a second-quarter expansion to 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#041608a">nine additional major markets across the United
States.</a> Camel Snus, a smoke-free, spitless tobacco product that comes in a small pouch, is

remains optimistic about the potential for this new product.</font> Conwood - 
Moist-snuff category growth continued in the first quarter with a total industry volume increase
of 5.5 percent. Gains on Grizzly, and Kodiak’s improved performance, drove Conwood’s total moist-snuff
shipments up 1.2 share points to a first-quarter share of 26.9 percent. Grizzly’s continued
growth further strengthened the brand’s position as the industry’s third-largest and fastest growing
moist-snuff brand. That performance was aided by the recent
launch of two new Grizzly styles – Snuff and Wintergreen Pouch – which are both being
expanded nationally this year.

Swedish Match (Svenska Tandsticks)first quarter 2008 report..</font></a> Snuff/Snus: In Scandinavia, sales volumes measured 
in number of cans, 
were up by 8 percent during the first quarter compared to the previous year.  As a result of the tax increase (effective
 January 1, 2008) sales volumes were unusually low in the first quarter of both 2007 and 2008. In the US, sales volumes
 during the first quarter were up by 22 percent compared to the same period in the previous year. Volumes for Longhorn 
and Timber Wolf combined were up by 7 percent. Volumes of Red Man moist snuff contributed significantly 
to the volume increase, as the brand began to be rolled out nationally. Cigars: Excluding the impact of acquisitions,
 sales in local currencies were down approximately 25 percent for premium cigars in the US primarily due to lower
 shipments to national accounts and trade destocking. It is expected that in the coming quarters there will be a return 
to more normal shipment levels for premium cigars. Sales of mass market cigars in the US also decreased. Higher shipments 
are expected for mass market cigars in the US from new product launches going forward. For the remainder of the year, 
sales and operating profit in the US should therefore improve. Chewing tobacco: sold primarily on the North American market,
 mainly in the southern US. Swedish Match is the leading producer of chewing tobacco in the US. Well known brands 
include Red Man and Southern Pride. The chewing tobacco segment shows a declining trend. During the first quarter,

UST, Inc. Executives Very Disappointed in Sales of the Entire SNUS Segment..</font></a> 
Comments from Murray S. Kessler, Chairman and CEO, UST, Inc. and Dan Butler, President of USSTC (United States
Smokeless Tobacco Company) - UST, Inc. Q1 2008 Earnings Call Transcript, 4/24/2008. <font size="2">(UST Inc. is

 Mr. Butler is very disappointed with the progress of the SNUS segment in total. 
The entire segment itself has gained very little 
traction, and we had plans to be more aggressive. Frankly, we are revisiting those because the size
 of this market and how slowly it's developing -- it's so tiny and taking so long to gain any traction.
 We've got almost seven years of experience with Revel SNUS and our competitors out there now for a couple 
of years -- we're struggling whether this segment is really going to take hold or not and whether 
an American consumer is really interested in this form of tobacco or not. So, we will probably 
continue some testing and make some modifications, but we are less enthusiastic and, frankly, disappointed.

Regarding R.J. Reynolds Tobacco recently announced that they're going to roll out their Camel Snus marketing
 to a number of more metropolitan markets like New York City and San Francisco.</a> (
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#042008c">TobaccoWatch.org comments
on the expansion of the Camel snus test market.</a>)
  I can't 
speculate on what Reynolds approach is. Obviously going into metro markets is a different kind of approach.
 From our perspective, the category still has not gained significant traction and quite frankly, we're
 disappointed in the consumer response to it. We've all talked about the fact that it's going to take 
time and education to create a consumer awareness and trial. But what we're seeing in market for all
 of the players is, versus some reasonable velocities in the early days when they were very heavily promoted, 
sequentially the volume has really not held up and has declined overtime. So, we're really trying 
to figure out the right steps to take going forward and what the appropriate approach and level of 
investment is in the segment. <br><br>
Murray Kessler - We are very disappointed in the total performance
 of whether -- they call it Snus or we call it spit-free. We've been testing this thing now for
 seven years. The newer entrance, if you go back, is now, in original markets, is over two years, and it is not
 gaining the traction, given the level of investment that's been put there. (TobaccoWatch.org)

Altria Group's first-quarter 2008 profit falls 11 per cent on spinoff costs..</font></a> 
(<a href="#">
Altria Group profile</a> - also Altria has an 29 per cent
 stake in London-based SABMiller PLC, the world's 2nd largest brewery and brewer of Miller beer.)
Profit fell 11 per 
cent, in part because of costs related to the spinoff of Philip Morris International Inc. and relocating its 
corporate headquarters from New York to Richmond. Cigarette sales
 volume at the company's Philip Morris USA unit was down about 3.5 per cent, when adjusted for changes 
in trade inventories. The Marlboro brand achieved a 41.5 per cent share in the first quarter,
 compared with 40.8 per cent in the year-ago period. PM USA estimates that total cigarette industry 
volume declined approximately 4% in the first quarter. For the full-year 2008, 
PM USA estimates a total cigarette industry volume decline of approximately 3%.
The first-quarter results also included, for the 1st time those of cigar manufacturer John Middleton Inc., which 
the company acquired in December. Middleton's sales were $91 million, company officials said.
 Middleton's first-quarter retail share through February 2008 increased 2.7 share points 
versus year-ago to 26.8% of the machine-made large cigar segment, driven by Black & Mild. 
Retail share for Black & Mild increased 3.0
 share points versus year-ago to 25.9% of the machine-made large cigar segment. 
 As part of its adjacency growth strategy to develop new revenue and income sources for the future, 
PM USA is test marketing Marlboro Snus in Dallas, TX in August of 2007 and
 expanded the test into the Indianapolis, IN area 
in the first quarter of 2008. PM USA believes snus offers long-term potential as an alternative product 
for adult smokers as well as other adult tobacco users. 
In addition, PM USA is test marketing Marlboro Moist Smokeless Tobacco, which is designed 
to provide a premium quality product at an attractive price for adult moist smokeless tobacco consumers.
 PM USA began testing Marlboro Moist Smokeless Tobacco in the Atlanta area in October 2007, and expanded 
the test market to include additional counties in the greater Atlanta, Georgia area in the first quarter of 2008.

April 21, 2008 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">The primary reason to increase the tax on 
tobacco is to get smokers to quit and dissuade kids from starting..</font>
The evidence is clear that increasing the price of cigarettes is one of
the most effective ways to reduce smoking, especially among children.
Studies show that every 10 percent increase in the price of cigarettes
reduces youth smoking by about 7 percent and overall cigarette consumption
by about 4 percent. There is no guarantee that every state that has significantly
increased its cigarette tax will enjoy significant increases in revenue
even while reducing smoking. 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#040408b">
In Iowa in the 12 months before the one dollar cigarette tax increase, 
the state took in just less than $91 million in tax revenues from cigarettes. That revenue jumped to 
just over $219 million in the last 12 months. That's a 142 percent increase. At this same time
cigarette sales fall by 36%.</a>

$0.77 to $1.77)is not generating as much revenue as expected. As Governor Jim Doyle's spokesperson pointed 
out - the most important part of the tax was to stop people from smoking (and stop young people from 
starting), even if the revenue is less. (<a href="http://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2696">   
State cigarette tax millions short of earlier projections</a> by Charles Brace, The Daily Cardinal, 4/14/2008)
An analysis of recent tobacco tax increases conducted by Altria, the parent 
of Philip Morris USA Inc., concluded that three-fourths of them had raised less money than projected. 
Since 2002, 43 states and the District of Columbia have enacted 76 distinct tobacco tax increases,
 raising the average state tax to $1.13 from 61 cents, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.
 The R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company estimates that state taxes now generate $14.5 billion 
in revenue, while the federal excise tax of 39 cents a pack raises $7.3 billion.

Philip Morris International (PMI) has better prospects than Altria..</font></a>
Altria spun off its overseas operations to shareholders on March 28, 2008 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#033108b">
leaving Philip Morris 
International</a> as the largest publicly traded tobacco company in the world.
 Only the state-owned China National Tobacco sells more cigarettes. The idea behind 
the split was to give Philip Morris International room to flourish. While tobacco use has
 waned for decades in the developed world, it is growing in China, Russia, India and other 
emerging nations. Beyond making 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#041108a">
inroads 
in China</a>, PM's main task will be to push 
the Marlboro brand more overseas. (
<a href="#">
Marlboro is the dominant brand in the global tobacco 
market</a>, with an 8.5% share excluding the Chinese market. That's four times the size of its largest rival.)
A beachhead in the tightly controlled Chinese tobacco market, the world's largest, gives PM an edge
 over competitors. It is the only tobacco company that has struck a standing deal with Chinese National Tobacco.
That means PM can sell its popular 
<a href="Marlboro_Smoking_Causes_Erectile_Dysfunction.jpg">
Marlboro brand of cigarettes</a> and 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#012908">

 It is estimated that achievement of a modest 10% market share in China
 over the next ten years would add nearly two percentage points annually to PM's growth in sales volume.

Sales in these stores and

will take time to learn the proper technique of sucking on the moist snuff packet. 
As pointed out by Matthew Myers, the president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, all the

 Just like cigarettes, the use of SNUS, Swedish moist

were smokers and common afflictions were heart and cancer-related illnesses. The use of snus has been found to increase the
risk of premature death by around 10 percent in comparison with those who do not use any tobacco products, according to Upsala Nya Tidning. "Even if
smoking is without question a much greater threat to health than snus our research rejects the view that the use of Swedish snus is
in principle without risk," said Dr. Ann Roosaar at the Odontological Institute at Karolinska Institutet in Solna. The study began in the 
middle of the 1970s with the examination of the mouths of most of the inhabitants in the municipalities of Enköping and Håbo. The subjects 
also answered questions about their tobacco and alcohol habits. 
 <font size="4" style="Background-color:red">
In contrast to previous studies this one shows that mouth and throat
cancers were more common among users of snus, according to Roosaar.</font>

(NZHTA Report, February 2007,

published relating to smoking. More and more studies are surfacing

R.J. Reynolds Tobacco launches web site to help retailers and other opponents fight tobacco taxes..</font></a> The 
<a href="http://www.nocigtax.com/">
website  - nocigtax.com</a> enables like minded opponents to contact elected officials to voice objections. 
The site, run by Kottak, Lester and fellow Reynolds American communications official John Singleton, is a convenient 
platform for retailers, wholesalers and other interested parties to discuss all bills that propose to raise federal or 
state taxes across the country. The user-friendly website features states with actual tax-increase proposals while 
allowing users to track their own states. In addition, it provides key highlights of the bill and lets the user find his 
or her state representative to contact by email. "There are two important pieces to note on this," Riser said. "The first would 
be that retailers and wholesalers, just like all of us, are nonstop running their business. They don't have much time, even though 
they are politically engaged. We want them to have a resource that provides information, heightens awareness very quickly 
and then [provides] a resource to contact elected officials in less than 3 minutes." "Wouldn't three minutes be worth the time to 
help protect your livelihood?" Riser added. "That's what we're trying to do here." FROM THE WEBSITE: fight tobacco tax

Russian State Duma (Parliament) ratified the framework convention of the World Health Organization (WHO) on tobacco control..</font></a>
<a href="FCTCgen.html">
Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC)</a> has been joined by 172 countries, including the European Union (EU), but not all 
countries implement it with the same zeal. Spain, the Netherlands, Norway and Italy 
have banned smoking in public places, whereas Australia, Brazil, Canada, Singapore and Thailand have so
 far limited themselves to frightening pictures about the risks of smoking on cigarette packs.
 Olga Borzova, who chairs the Duma's committee for health protection, quoted a sad statistic - 
every year, up to half a million Russians die of smoking-related diseases. 
Rospotrebnadzor, Russia's consumer rights regulator, estimates that in the last 20 years the number 
of smokers has risen by 440,000. Some 65% of men and more than 30% of women smoke in Russia. Doctors insist that
 a quarter of regular smokers will die prematurely. Today, the Ministry of Health and Social Development and law-makers are 
together drafting a national strategy of tobacco control to meet the convention's main requirements.
Borzova said it may be adopted before the end of this year. The U.S. signed the FCTC treaty in 2004, to date 
it has not ratified it.
Signing of the treaty without ratification commits countries to support it, but does not create a legal obligation to abide by its provisions.

 <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">RJR adds more test marketing cities for Camel SNUS..</font></a>
 R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. (RJR) on Friday, April 11, 2008 said that it is 
expanding the test marketing of <a href="Camel_SNUS_spice.jpg">Camel SNUS</a> - their refrigerated, smokeless, spitless moist snuff pouch product
(with the tagline will be "Pleasure for where ever, whenever") from eight to 17 metropolitan areas starting in May 2008.
The new markets are Atlanta, Baltimore/Washington, 
<a href="http://www.chicagohotblog.com/chicago-smoking-ban">
Chicago</a>, Los Angeles, Miami, 
<a href="http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/smoking-ban">
Minneapolis/St. Paul</a>, New York City, Oakland/San Francisco and Seattle. 
Camel Snus is the first snus product by a U.S. tobacco manufacturer introduced into those markets.
"We're continuing to learn about the potential of Camel Snus as a viable product among adult tobacco users," said David Howard, a company spokesman.
"We know snus is gaining traction.". 
 It has not set a timetable for distributing and marketing Camel Snus nationally. The current test sites are:
Austin, Texas; Columbus, Ohio; Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas; Indianapolis; Kansas City, Mo.; Orlando, Fla.; Portland, Ore.; and Raleigh.
The product is available at Sheetz convenience stores in Winston-Salem and at convenience stores in Greensboro and High Point.
<br<br>
Although Reynolds does not dictate the price of Camel Snus at retail, the price is comparable to a premium pack of cigarettes,
 which typically sell for $4 to $4.50, Howard said. The competition for snus products has gotten tighter in recent months.
Liggett Group LLC said on Feb. 26 that it would begin testing in May its

“The bottom line is that this bill will save lives, plain and simple,” he said at a jam-packed signing ceremony.

 Swedish male smokers may increase their overall chances of abstinence. However, 71% of the men in this sample who quit smoking

The trend for Swedish women's smoking habits also refutes the myth that SNUS use is a necessary component to reduce smoking. Between

smoking in cars with children enacted in the State of Maine..</font></a> 
 Maine's law, modeled after an ordinance 
adopted by the City of Bangor, which will take effect 90 days
 after this spring's legislative session ends, will outlaw smoking in cars in which youths under 16 are present. The bill authorizes
 $50 fines for violations, but only after the first year. In the meantime, warnings will be issued. The bill was weakened from 
the original version, which would have outlawed smoking if someone 18 or younger was in the vehicle and imposed fines right away. While 
the changes disappointed some of the bill's most ardent backers,
 legislative support remained strong and the bill encountered no serious setbacks.

Sixteen year old  - "The preferred method
 of tobacco in school these days, he said, is smokeless tobacco. The current rage is a less conspicuous 
product called "Snus" (pronounced "snoos"), a non-chew, no-spit oral tobacco that's stuffed between the lip and gum.
One of the more popular brands, 
<a href="Camel_SNUS_spice.jpg">
Camel Snus</a> with the tagline will be "Pleasure for where ever, whenever", manufactured by tobacco 
giant RJ Reynolds, is sold in tea-bag like pouches about
 the size of a lozenge. Teachers can't easily detect the pouches, so kids can fly under the radar when they use it in school. 
Even so, the habit has become so prevalent that there have been recent announcements on the loudspeaker at my son’s high school 
reminding students that smokeless tobacco is a code of conduct violation. When I asked my son 
how common it was, he guessed that about 10 percent of the boys in his class were using it.</font>
A 
<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5505a1.htm">
Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report released in June 2006</a>, revealed that the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use 
is closer to 14 percent among high school-aged boys and a little over 2 percent among girls. The rate varied widely 
across states with 4.4% usage among male students in Maryland and 26.5% in West Virginia. Overall, the percentage was highest
 among white male students (17.6%) and rose each year from 9th to 12th grade among male students.
According to the CDC, smokeless tobacco carries four dangerous health effects: It contains 28 cancer-causing agents (carcinogens);
It’s a well- known cause of cancer, increasing the risk of cancer of the mouth; Oral health problems strongly associated with
 smokeless tobacco use are leukoplakia (a lesion of the soft tissue that consists of a white patch or plaque that cannot be scraped off)
 and recession of the gums; Smokeless tobacco use can lead to nicotine addiction and dependence and adolescents who use smokeless tobacco
 are more likely to become cigarette smokers. It’s quite possible that kids are unaware of these warnings. the five largest smokeless tobacco manufacturers spent a new
 record of $250.79 million on smokeless tobacco advertising and promotion during 2005 alone.
<i>We are afraid those tobacco control people that favor the use 
of SNUS in harm reduction are convincing our youngsters that the product is save so give it a try.

force the FDA to regulate tobacco..</font> 
The Lorillard Tobacco, the third largest manufacturer of cigarettes 
in the United States, including the Newport brand, the best selling menthol cigarette in the country,
Company today issued the following statement with regard to the passage of a
bill H.R. 1108, the ‘Family Smoking Prevention and 
Tobacco Control Act’ by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce that would force the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate the tobacco industry. (Newport cigarettes, responsible for 80% Lorillard sales,
are very popular among the <a href="NewportAd1970Ebony.jpg">African-American community.</a>"The Lorillard Tobacco Company 
opposes H.R. 1108 -- legislation that would
force the FDA to regulate tobacco. <br><br> While Lorillard fully supports reasonable
federal regulation of the tobacco industry, the FDA already is overworked by
Congress and is the wrong agency for the job. The challenges facing FDA are
well documented. Adding a new industry for the FDA to oversee when it is
struggling to fulfill its core mission is misguided. It will only compromise
the health and safety of millions of Americans. "This legislation also has fundamental
 problems. <br><br>It would codify a
12-year-old FDA regulation that is blatantly unconstitutional, providing
competitive advantage to our larger rivals. In addition, it makes the
development and marketing of safer tobacco products impossible while providing
no guidance to the FDA as to how to carry out this new regulation.
"It is important to note that FDA Commissioner <a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#100507">"Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach
has made it abundantly clear that he does not believe FDA should be the agency
to regulate tobacco.</a> Tobacco is not a drug or device that should be regulated
by the FDA. Forcing the FDA to depart from its core mission to regulate a
product that is inherently dangerous is simply wrong." (<a href="http://press-release-depot.com/pr/statement-from-lorillard-tobacco-on-fda-tobacco-regulation-legislation.html">

profits for Swedish Match's Snus division in the 1st quarter 2007. In Scandinavia, shipment volume 
in cans, during the fourth quarter were down 9 percent compared to the same period in the previous year.
Effective January 1, 2008 the excise 
tax on snus in Sweden increased by 37 percent to 336 SEK per kilogram. This followed a doubling of
 excise taxes on snus effective January 1, 2007. Altogether the excise tax for snus in Sweden
 has increased by 173 percent compared to the level in 2006.

David Paterson and legislative leaders huddled behind closed doors

 talks said the enhanced tax would be on top of the current $1.50 tax per pack upstate
 and $3 per pack in New York City, making New York the leader in such surcharges on smokers. The tax, as proposed, 
would reap about $265 million more in revenues, although an overall financial plan was still in flux late Sunday. They said the plans are to be printed into budget bills to be voted 
on as soon as today (3/31/2008). <font size="4">Also, the deal involves changing the way snuff and other moist tobacco products are taxed

to a percentage of the wholesale price.</font> The increased tobacco taxes would go a long way toward helping the Legislature pay for $500
 million in extra spending
 above Paterson's plan. As a  result, school aid is expected to rise $1.8 billion to more than $21 billion. Health care spending would rise 
above Paterson's plan by between $235 million to $245 million, largely because lawmakers wanted to provide more

 premium segment of the market, where it estimates that it held a 52.4% share (excluding China) in 2007. According to  Business Week's annual 
rankings report, "The Best Global Brands 2007," the Marlboro brand was worth a cool $21.3 billion, placing it 14th on the list,
 and ahead of such household names as American Express and PepsiCo. In 2007, Marlboro's volume of 311 billion units was larger than 
the next three best selling international brands combined. It also outsells the total 
combined volume of all of British American Tobacco's global drive brands. <a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#012908">

According to  The Wall Street Journal, big tobacco companies are aiming squarely at developing countries,
where populations are increasing and smoking is a status symbol. (<a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2008/02/22/smoking-around-the-world.aspx">

is the big bully threatening c-store owners. PM has come with the <font size="4">T-set arrangement</font> of their cigarettes directly behind
 checkout counter. The cigarettes from other companies would then occupy the remaining space. 
  What's the payoff
for the c-store owner: from PM on-invoice gets $3.50 from Davenport the wholesaler in the Raleigh area for every carton of Marlboro, Basic
 and Parliament sold, off-invoice the owner gets $2.00 per carton, then an additional check that varies from $2.00 to $3.00 for each carton 
sold and finally once a month a check for the space occupied. RJR off-invoice only gives $8.00 for each carton of Doral sold and $6
 for each carton of Camel sold and then a check comes once a month for the space occupied by RJR products based on sales and Lorillard
 gives $6.00 per carton sold of their cigarettes (mainly Newport) 
and a check for $100 for space no matter how much product has been sold. All tobacco products belong under the counter,

March 27, 2008 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Starting in January 2009 Australia may require all cigarettes manufactured
 and sold throughout Australia to be self-extinguishing..</font> A meeting of emergency services ministers in Canberra 
(the capital city of the Commonwealth of Australia) on Wednesday (3/26/2008) deliberated upon the need for introducing "fire-proof" 
cigarettes that get extinguished on their own as the smoker drops the butt, a measure that may help reduce the risk of fires in homes and the bush.
New South Wales (NSW) Emergency Services Minister Nathan Rees moved the resolution to make the reduced fire risk (RFR) cigarettes, 
mandatory under the Trade Practices Act as early as next year. "Every day's delay is another day we live with the risk that someone 
will be killed or injured or homes or bushland destroyed because cigarettes keep burning when they are dropped or thrown from a car window," he added.
Each year, around 4500 fires are caused by cigarette ignitions in Australia. Fires, directly attributed to cigarettes, claimed
 about 65 lives between 2000 and 2005. A spokesman for the Australian arm of British American Tobacco (BAT) said the company 
was broadly supportive of the aim. "BAT supports the goal of reducing the incidents of fires caused by the careless disposal of lit cigarettes,"
 spokesman Bede Fennell.  "It is important, however, that smokers are aware that cigarettes produced to meet the proposed reduced-fire risk
 standard are not fire safe and all lit cigarettes should be carefully disposed of." <a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#032508a">Liggett Tobacco,

March 26, 2008 -  <a href="http://www.heraldextra.com/content/view/260381/3/"><font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Utah moves from a tax based on the percentage of sales price to one based on the weight - independent of price of smokeless 
tobacco product..</font></a>  The Legislature passed and the governor signed House Bill 356. It changed how "moist snuff" is taxed, from a 
35-percent tax on the wholesale price to 75 cents per ounce. In other words, the most-expensive brands formerly bore the heaviest taxes.
 But imposing one flat rate will bring down the taxes on the pricier brands, and raise them on the cheaper ones. 
The bill which takes effect May 1, 2008 will lower the cost of premium moist snuff brands like Skoal and Copenhagen.
 UST <font size="2">
(principal subsidiaries: U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company and Ste. Michelle Wine Estates)</font> the maker of these 
brands has aggressively pushed for taxing smokeless tobacco on a per-weight basis. According to the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention these premium brands are most preferred by users 12 and older.
<br><br>
Reducing the taxes and as a result the prices would directly increase youth smokeless tobacco initiation and use, dooming even more kids to a
lifetime of tobacco addiction, related harms, and premature death. Failing to have different weight-based tax rates for each different
 type or style of product within the smokeless or moist snuff categories would end up grossly under taxing lighter weight
products. Most importantly, the newest trend in smokeless moist snuff products is
toward spitless pre-packed single-dose tablets or pouches, such as Ariva and Stonewall
lozenges, RJR's Camel Snus, Philip Morris's Marlboro Snus and UST's Skoal Dry. This new
generation of smokeless moist snuff tobacco products weigh as little as one-tenth per dose
compared to the standard moist snuff that comes in a can. Any switch to a weight-based tax
would allow these emerging products to pay almost nothing, thereby sharply reducing state revenues.

<a href="Cigarette_Consumption_1990_2005.JPG">
decline in 
cigarette sales in the U.S.</a> traditional cigarette companies are turning to smokeless tobacco products to bolster their growth. 
Smokeless tobacco sales volume actually 
decreased by 11% from 1986 to 2003 (from 125.5 to 114.3 million pounds); most of this decline resulted from large drops in sales
 of chewing tobacco and dry snuff (-49% and -67%, respectively). In marked contrast, the use of moist snuff or dip,
  increased dramatically over this same period (+87%); moist snuff now represents 62% of the smokeless tobacco market.
(Nelson et al.,Trends in Smokeless Tobacco Use 
Among Adults and Adolescents in the United States, 
<a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/530786_1">
Am J Public Health 96(5)897-905, 2006</a>)
The moist smokeless tobacco (MST) products are divided between premium products segment such 
as Copenhagan, Skoal, Kodiak and Marlboro MST  and 
the price/value (discount)segment represented by Grizzly (Reynolds American/Conwood), Longhorn (Swedish Match, N.A.) and Husky (USSTC). The 
price/value segment drives overall growth in the moist snuff category. Since 2003, the share of premium brands decreased from 72% to 59.6%
while the price/value offerings increased from 23.3% to 34.8% (AC Nielson 52-week period ending 12/31/2005). 
In 2005 alone, price/value sales 
increased nearly 44%, while premium can sales declined by 4.7% (AC Nielsen 52-week period ending 12/31/2005). SNUS products such as 
Camel SNUS, Marlboro SNUS,  Skoal Dry and Lorillard's Triumph SNUS are considered part of the premium segment.
 As we pointed out to the Liggett 
people prior to the test marketing of <a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#022708a">
Grand Prix SNUS</a>, these SNUS products will have a hard time catching on and it will take many years to create 
public acceptance - if possible. Swedish SNUS type products have failed in most countries outside of Sweden. In the U.S. Philip Morris'
Taboka SNUS and USSTC's Revel SNUS have already failed and sales of the others have done poorly.      
Remember the expenditure on cigarettes in 2005 was $82 billion and for the smokeless tobacco category about $3.7 billion. (TobaccoWatch.org)

March 22, 2008 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">News from Convenience Stores -  Competition for Space is Getting Ruthless..</font> The big three U.S.
 cigarette companies: Philip Morris USA
(PM), R.J. Reynolds Tobacco and Lorillard are aggressively competing for advertising space in convenience stores. The point-of-purchase 
environment, i.e., the convenience store is the main channel through which tobacco companies can entice new tobacco users and retain
existing smokers. No longer can tobacco companies advertise on TV, radio, or on billboards and are very limited in print media. The tobacco industry 
spends more on in-store advertising than all other forms of advertisement combined in 2004 - $11.86 billion vs $2.29 billion. These companies
 pay promotional allowances to retailers to stock and display their products according to exact specifications.  For this particular 
c-store Philip Morris is demanding 65% of the display space because they claim PM tobacco products are 65% of tobacco sales. 
Already PM threatened to cut off the store's off invoice allowance if one of the center shelves now occupied by Lorillard brands aren't removed
and replaced by PM tobacco products. As the congressional bill to have the federal government provide tobacco regulation, that PM supports, 
 makes its way through the U.S congress the tension grows amongst PM competitors. It is thought that PM was involved with crafting this
 bill - e.g. in the latest version of the bill, 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#012908">

Gene knockout reduces carcinogens in tobacco leaves..</font></a> Scientists have found that the amount of certain carcinogens in tobacco can be reduced 
by silencing a specific gene in its plant. This may lead to tobacco products with reduced amount of cancer-causing agents, especially 
smokeless tobacco products (the carcinogens studied are more plentiful in these products). Professor Ralph Dewey and Assistant Professor Ramsey Lewis, both from North Carolina State University,
 joined hands with researchers from the University of Kentucky to deactivate the demethylase gene function that turns nicotine
 into nornicotine, which turns into the carcinogen N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) as the tobacco is cured, processed and stored.
Upon comparison with “control” plant lines with normal levels of gene expression, the genetically modified tobacco plants showed
 a six-fold decrease in carcinogenic NNN, and a 50 percent overall reduction in the class of harmful compounds
 called tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNA) that have been implicated in various cancers in laboratory experiments.
In their study report, published online in Plant Biotechnology Journal, Lewis and Dewey say that targeted gene silencing can work 
as well in the field as it does on the lab bench. It was also found that knocking out the specific gene did not affect the plant’s
 growth or resistance to insects or disease. <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">One of the authors, Ralph Dewey admits the intent of the work is not to introduce
 genetically modified tobacco plants. "Once you find a trait of interest, introducing that trait into tobacco varieties that a farmer would 
grow takes numbers of years," Dewey said.</font> <font size="4">Click on image to enlarge..</font>

Justices turn down smokers' lawsuit against tobacco companies..</font></a>
The Supreme Court declined Monday (March 17, 2008) to consider a lawsuit accusing tobacco companies of turning minors into 
smokers by targeting them with cigarette advertising. The California Supreme Court 
(The California case is Daniels v. Philip Morris USA Inc., 07-740.) ruled against the smokers last August 2007, saying a 
federal law on cigarette advertising and the companies' First Amendment rights to commercial speech allow the marketing campaigns.
At issue is whether the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act pre-empts California law. The federal law confirms the authority
 of the Federal Trade Commission to regulate unfair or deceptive practices in cigarette advertising. The smokers sued under California
 law barring unfair competition. The competition is alleged to be unfair in this case because competing tobacco companies that respect
 state law operate at a disadvantage. Urging the Supreme Court to turn down the case, the tobacco companies say the federal 
law pre-empts any state law prohibition on cigarette ads if the prohibition is based on smoking and health.

 tobacco products.)
The R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. started selling 
<a href="#">

in which it plans to  test-launch its <a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#022708a">
Grand Prix snus</a> this summer. The tide of snus comes about a year after a tough anti-smoking 
law took effect across Ohio (December 7, 2006), barring people from lighting up in virtually all public buildings. R.J. Reynolds acknowledged 
that the ban, and similar anti-smoking laws in other states, played a role in its decision to market snus.
 A Lorillard advertisement for 
Triumph in Ohio also alludes to the smoking ban: "No smoking? No problem." Representatives of the American Lung Association 
and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids held a news conference Wednesday  (3/12/2008) to decry
 the spread of snus in Ohio. They noted that, while smokeless tobacco doesn't cause lung cancer or emphysema, 
it is blamed for mouth cancers and heart disease caused by increased heart rates. (Other dangers of SNUS use includes the increased risk of the
 most deadly of all cancers -

COLUMBUS, Ohio</a> (AP) — <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Ohio State University asked tobacco giant R.J. 
Reynolds to stop using what looked like the university's famous block "O" in an advertisement for their smokeless tobacco product - Camel SNUS..</font>
The ad for Camel Snus tobacco pouches was brought to the attention of university officials recently by anti-tobacco advocates. The ad 
used in a Columbus alternative newspaper features a man and woman in a nightclub setting with an "O" in the background - see IMAGE.
 R.J. Reynolds spokesman David Howard said the company had "absolutely no intention" of using Ohio State's block "O" in its advertisement,
 which also ran in alternative newspapers in places like Orlando, Fla., and Dallas (also Raleigh). What looks like an "O" is actually
 part of a "003," Howard aid, but the first zero and the "3" are in a faint outline
 and the middle "0" is in bolder font. Howard did not know the significance of the number. The ads stopped running last year
 and will not run again, Howard said. The numbering
 was also in a brochure, which will be out of stores by the end of April at the latest, he said.

<a href="swedish_match_more.html">
Swedish Match</a>, the fastest
 growing moist snuff company in the US, announced the national launch of Red Man Moist Snuff, the latest product to carry the most recognized brand name 
in smokeless tobacco. This follows a successful test market launch last year in 11 states, which represented 36% of the moist snuff category volume.
 "Consumer acceptance of Red Man Moist Snuff in the test markets was overwhelming," according to Elliot Eliades, Director of New Product
 Development for Swedish Match North America. "Through event marketing, retail intercept
(interview customer at point of sale)
 and website driven sampling we accelerated consumer
 trial by quickly getting 'cans in hands'. Early awareness scores indicated that Red Man Moist Snuff created significant consumer buzz."
<i>Red Man is a leading brand of chewing tobacco in the United States. The 1st attempt at a Red Man Moist Snuff (MST) failed. - TW</i>
Post test market research confirms that the brand’s authenticity transfers well from loose leaf to moist snuff. <br><br> Eliades adds, "This tells 
us Red Man Moist Snuff will climb the consumer acceptance curve at an accelerated rate."
The new moist snuff offers consumers a premium brand with a respectable price. The national launch of Red Man Moist Snuff
 is supported by major print advertising, direct mail, and visually appealing, high impact point of sale materials, product sampling 
for adult consumers in adult-oriented venues, and a co-promotion with Maxim magazine. Related news briefs:

after the spin-off of PMI on March 28, 2008..</font></a> On 28 March 2008, PMI will become a separate business entity that will focus
 on strong business growth in emerging economies as US sales decline.The move may exempt PMI from US tobacco regulations and negative public 
opinion while enabling greater freedom to experiment with new product lines. (According to the World Health Organisation, smoking is 
rising 3.4% a year in developing countries as it falls in developed nations.) Cigarette shipment volume has declined by 8% since 2003 but operating
companies income increased 29% highlighting the ability to grow profitable in a declining market.  Philip Morris International forecast
 long-term annual revenue growth of 4 percent to 6 percent and volume growth of 1 percent to 2 percent. By the end of 2010, 
it expects cost savings of $1 billion and cumulative total cash flow of about $22 billion.
Andre Calantzopoulos, who will be chief operating officer of Philip Morris International, said there are plenty of areas in the world for 
Philip Morris to grow its business. "In the international market, there are still more than five out of every six adult smokers who are 
consuming brands that are not manufactured and sold by PMI," he said. Among large cigarette markets where the company has little or no 
presence, he cited China, Vietnam, India and Bangladesh.
Philip Morris International plans to spend about $300 million a year on research and development, split evenly between conventional 
products and new items like the "Heatbar" electronically heated cigarette that is currently being market tested. Some directly related

March 9, 208 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Smokeless Tobacco Revisited - Confusion Still Exists..</font>  There are two types of smokeless tobacco (ST) chewing tobacco 
and snuff (moist and dry) Chewing tobacco and dry snuff have fallen in popularity. The only part of the tobacco market in which sales are
growing  is moist snuff.  These products can be SMOKELESS BUT NOT SPITLESS and others are BOTH SMOKELESS AND SPITLESS. Examples of only 
smokeless are UST's Skoal, Copenhagen; RJR-Conwood's Kodiak, Swedish Match's Red Man Moist Snuff and Philip Morris' Marlboro Moist  
Smokeless Tobacco. The NON-SPITLESS (American style) SNUFF usually contains high amounts of moisture (50% or more, and lots of salt) and 
<a href="snus_general_info.html">
SMOKELESS and SPITLESS (Swedish style) SNUFF called SNUS</a>  contains less moisture and less salt. SNUS comes in two forms loose
 and portioned.   Original snus (loose-weight), is a moist powder which can be portioned and packed into a cylindrical or spherical shape with
 the fingertips or SNUS portioner and Portion-packed SNUS - the type marketed in the U.S., is prepackaged powder in small bags made from the 
same material as teabags. White portioned SNUS contains even less moisture (and the taste may be enhanced).The main ingredients in the preparation of SNUS are ground tobacco, water, salt (ordinary cooking salt)
 and sodium carbonate. Additional ingredients are aromatic compounds and moisture-preserving substances. The salt is 
added for two reasons: to add to the flavor
 and to extend the shelf life of SNUS. Sodium carbonate (or potassium carbonate)is used to give 
the SNUS its characteristic flavor and aroma and also gives it a slightly basic pH value.  
<a href="http://www.healthline.com/blogs/smoking_cessation/2007/06/why-did-philip-morriss-new-smokeless.html">
 Jonathan Foulds has described SNUS as moist snuff typically 
containing about 50% water.</a> We believe this value to too high - the value is more like 10-15% water like found for Marlboro Snus. A CDC 
study analyzed the nicotine, pH and moisture content of six NON-SPITLESS SNUFF (e.g., Copenhagen, Skoal, Skoal Bandits, Kodiak) products found 
the moisture content ranged from 48.9% to 54.1% and the pH ranged from 5.55 for Skoal Bandits Straight to around 8.1 for Copenhagen.
(<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4819a3.htm">
MMWR,v48#19,May 21, 1999</a>) The amount of nicotine a person might actually obtain from smokeless tobacco products varies according to a number of factors, including
 how long a person holds the product in his or her mouth, how large of a pinch of tobacco is placed in the mouth,
 the quantity of nicotine in the tobacco, and the quantity of un-ionized nicotine in the tobacco.
Nicotine in tobacco exists in two chemical forms – "free" (un-ionized) nicotine and "bound" (ionized) nicotine. The pH of a smokeless 
tobacco product can affect the estimated amount of its nicotine present in the un-ionized form as compared to the ionized form. The un-ionized 
nicotine is known to be the form of nicotine absorbed most easily in the mouth
  <a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#111007a">In order to be called SPITLESS the packet (pouch, sachet)
has to be placed in a particular location in the mouth between the upper lip and gums and kept there with very little movement.</a>

The

 will give Canberra the toughest restrictions on tobacco sales in the country. The Tobacco Amendment Bill requires retailers 
to keep cigarette products below the counter or in draws where they cannot be seen. The bill also bans the sale of flavoured cigarettes 
and split packs. Ms Gallagher told the Assembly, the move to ban the display of tobacco products puts 
the ACT at the forefront of anti-smoking legislation. "The point-of-purchase display is one of the last remaining ways tobacco companies
 are able to display there wares," she said. "Storing tobacco out of sight will prevent people, particularly children, being able to see tobacco.
"Research shows that the point of sale display acts to promote and normalise smoking. The Territory will be the 
first to send a message that it is not normal." See related news briefs: <a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#020708b">

Dangers of hookah (waterpipe) smoking - Harvard Mental Health Letter..</font></a> A new fad among college students and other young people—smoking 
from a hookah—is raising public health concerns. The centuries-old tradition of smoking from a hookah, or waterpipe,
 is widely perceived to be less harmful and addictive than smoking cigarettes or other forms of tobacco. Yet a number of studies suggest
 that hookah smoking may be just as addictive and perhaps even more harmful because of the way people smoke
 while using a waterpipe. Researchers have found that hookah smokers inhale more often and for longer periods than typical cigarette smokers.
 Scientists estimate that by puffing longer and in greater volume, a waterpipe
 smoker inhales the equivalent of 100 cigarettes or more during a single waterpipe session.

Tobacco a threat to pregnant women and children in developing world..</font></a> An NIH study indicates that rates of tobacco 
use during pregnancy, as well as exposure of pregnant women and their young children to 
secondhand smoke, are significant threats to health in several low and middle-income countries. This study is the first to examine
 pregnant women's tobacco use, second-hand smoke exposure and attitudes toward women's tobacco use in multiple developing countries.
The study was conducted by an international team of investigators,
The researchers conducted this investigative survey in nine developing nations to get a preliminary look at the magnitude of the problem.
 The researchers found as many as 18 percent of pregnant women currently smoked cigarettes, up to one-third used smokeless tobacco,
 and as many of half were regularly exposed to secondhand smoke in the nations studied. Uruguay and Argentina had the highest levels
 of smoking during pregnancy across
 all ten study sites (18 percent and 10 percent respectively). In the Indian sites, one-third of all pregnant women used smokeless 
tobacco in Orissa and about twenty percent of pregnant women in Karnataka were often exposed to secondhand smoke. The highest levels of secondhand 
smoke exposure were found in Pakistan, where about half of all pregnant women and their young children were frequently or always exposed to 
secondhand smoke. About one in ten pregnant
 women at the site in Pakistan reported that they had tried cigarette smoking. Lead study author -

Ohio youth are using cigars and smokeless tobacco products and it is a continuously growing problem..</font>
Other tobacco products (OTP) include non-cigarette forms of tobacco like cigars, smokeless tobacco, and hookah tobacco. While high school 
students have decreased their use of cigarettes, they have not decreased their use of smokeless tobacco or cigars.
 These products come in candy flavors and
 kid-friendly packaging and are often displayed in convenience stores near candy and snacks. The tobacco industry spends over $2 million
 a day promoting smoking and chewing tobacco to Ohioans, even in places kids go, like convenience stores. Columbus is the test market
for Camel Snus marketed by RJ Reynolds. Young African Americans, Appalachian Ohioans, and young males are especially at risk. Little cigar
 use is especially high among young, African-American males, and smokeless use is a special problem for males in Appalachian Ohio.
 Among males 18 to 24, over 37% use some form of tobacco product other than cigarettes.In 2007, U.S. Smokeless Tobacco sent mailers to smokers
 in Ohio encouraging them to use smokeless tobacco when in smoke-free public places. When legislators increased the cigarette
 tax in 2003 and 2005, they failed to also raise the OTP tax which covers non-cigarette forms of tobacco.

Cuban cigar sales rose 7 percent to $402 million in 2007..</a> The Cuban cigar company Habanos is owned jointly by the
Cuban government and Altadis SA, which was recently acquired by the Imperial Tobacco Group.
Cuban cigars comprise 80 percent of the world cigar market -- not counting the United States, which has had a trade embargo banning Cuban 
products since 1962. Spain, France, Germany, Switzerland and Cuba's domestic market remained top consumers of Cuban cigars last year,
 while sales in Canada fell 7 percent as stricter anti-smoking laws took hold, anos Vice President Manuel Garcia said. 
The company does not reveal how many individual cigars it sells a year, but the total
 is believed to be between 150 million and 160 million. Garcia spoke at the 10th annual Habanos Festival in Havana.
 Altadis, the manufacturer of Fortuna, Gitanes and Ducados cigarette brands, is also the world's leading cigar distributor of cigars through 
its 50-50 venture with the Cuban state.

  people that use snus are twice as likely to develop pancreatic cancer as people who don’t smoke or use smokeless tobacco.

March  2, 2008 - Reynolds American Subsidiary to Receive Payment Following Gallaher Joint-Venture Termination..
Reynolds American
Inc. (NYSE: RAI) announced today (February 21, 2008) that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco C.V. (RJR), an
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of RAI, will receive a payment of euro 265.0
million (approximately $387.6 million) from Gallaher Limited (Gallaher), a JT
International (JTI) Group company, resulting from the termination of the
joint-venture agreement between RJR and a Gallaher affiliate.
In 2002 US tobacco firm RJR formed Reynolds-Gallaher International to give the manufacturer access to cigarette sales in most 
countries in the European Union. It was scheduled to run through 2012 but in May 2007, as a result of the acquisition 
of Gallaher Group by Japan Tobacco, it was announced that this joint-venture would cease in November 2007. The joint venture marketed American-
blend cigarettes primarily in Italy, France and Spain. (Gallaher brands include Benson & Hedges, Silk Cut, Mayfair, Kensitas Club, Amber Leaf 
and Hamlet Cigars. Japan Tobacco became the sole owner of the Gallaher Group on 18 April 2007, in the largest ever foreign acquisition
 in Japanese history. (

for outdoor smokers..</font></a> Philip Morris, the tobacco giant, is planning a “snack-size” cigarette for the smoking-ban age. The compact cigarette
 will be shorter than existing brands but just as smoky: it will deliver the same potency while taking less time to puff. Marlboro Intense 
is designed to appeal to employees who are forced to take quick outdoor cigarette breaks while at work, often in cold weather. Philip Morris 
will test the cigarette in 
<a href="http://www.turkeyfinancial.com/news/2008/02/05/marlboro-intense-spark-nationwide-reaction">
Turkey</a> but believes it has worldwide potential, with more than 50 countries now having bans on smoking in public places.
The cigarette, which is 7.2cm long, compared with the normal 8.5cm, may offer some solace to smokers who face an even colder trip for their 
breaks if MEPs have their way. Last week, as part of the battle to combat climate change, MEPs demanded a ban on patio heaters, which many outdoor smokers rely
 on for warmth at work or while socialising. Stephen Pound, the MP who voted against the ban and then stopped smoking the next day, 
said: "The desperation of the smokers knows no limits; it’s only matched by the desperation in Philip Morris trying to corner the market."

with the purchase of 
<a href="Scandanvian_Ciagarettes.jpg">
Skandinavisk Tobakskompagni's (ST)</a> cigarettes for 
$4.1 billion (2 billion pounds) as it beat forecasts with an 11 percent rise in 2007 earnings. 
BAT, which agreed to buy Turkey's state-owned 
cigarette maker 
<a href="tekel2000.jpg">
Tekel</a> last Friday, is buying 100 percent of the cigarette assets of privately-owned Denmark-based ST with snus and 
roll-your-own tobacco. The Danish assets that BAT is buying account for 60 percent of cigarette sales in Scandinavia, led by its Prince brand,
 and the deal will give BAT market
 leadership in Denmark and Norway, and around a third of the Swedish and Polish cigarette markets.   It will add around 30 billion annual
 cigarette sales to BAT's 684 billion sales in 2007, or around the same size as Tekel's annual sales of 32 billion cigarettes. 
BAT Chief Executive Paul Adams added that although Scandinavian markets, like other mature European markets, were seeing cigarette volumes 
declining around 2 percent a year with public place smoking restrictions and high excise tax, the business it was buying was very profitable
 with high margins. ST units including Prince cigarettes and <a href="http://www.st.dk/sw12626.asp"><font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Fiedler & Lundgren, the Swedish maker of snus powdered

<br><br>
The acquisition of a
 100 per cent stake in Fiedler & Lundgren AB will strengthen British American Tobacco’s snus business 
and bring in-house manufacturing and additional expertise.  Fiedler & Lundgren sold almost 16 million tins of snus in 2006/07 with market
 shares of 6 per cent in Sweden and 4 per cent in Norway.  Brands include Granit, Mocca and Metropol.</a>

 London-based BAT already owned 32 percent of Soeborg, Denmark-based ST. ST was formed in 1961 by the merger of three Danish 
tobacco makers, including Chr. Augustinus Fabrikker, founded in 1750, according to the company's Web site. The company merged with a local 
BAT division in 1971, and its House of Prince is Scandinavia's largest cigarette company.

which will pit it against Philip Morris International in the world's eighth largest tobacco market. Sixty per cent of Turkish men smoke, making 
it an attractive market for BAT, which does most of its business in emerging markets. BAT will have 36 per cent of the market in Turkey.

February 27, 2008 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Grand Prix SNUS - Why Take the Risk on SNUS?? - A Product Consumers Find Unacceptable..</font>
 Liggett is following closely 
in the footsteps of Reynolds American Inc. (RJR) and Philip Morris USA (PM) in testing SNUS in select U.S. markets. In May 2008 Grand Prix SNUS 
will be sold in seven of the eight metropolitan areas being used by Reynolds for Camel Snus - Columbus, Ohio; Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas;
 Indianapolis; Kansas City; Orlando, Fla.; Portland, Ore.; and Raleigh, NC. Philip Morris is selling Marlboro SNUS in Dallas and plans to begin
testing it in Indianapolis in March. United States Smokeless Tobacco Company (UST)has been trying to market a SNUS product, Revel,  since 2001 with 
little success. Taboka Tobaccopaks,  a PM SNUS product,  did not perform well and is being pulled. Tobacco companies are in agreement for SNUS to
 catch on and be a strong seller it's going to require
 more <a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#121407b"> public awareness and education</a>. Tobacco companies are limited on how this can be accomplished.
They have tried reducing prices, giving away free coupons at c-store and also various bars, printing 
 brochures about SNUS and web sites identifying the glories of sucking on a tea-bag that must be placed in one particular place in your mouth
 without any movement for at least 30 minutes. Our friends in Dallas tell us when the Marlboro SNUS first arrived, it seemed very expensive, but
 now there are deep discounts and price promotions. Lots of the promotion has been in conjunction with Marlboro cigarettes – promotional
 signs on cigarette displays, samples of SNUS and coupons in cigarette packs, etc. with little success. Nik Modi, a UBS tobacco analyst has stated,
 "The Marlboro brand name is not as transferable as many originally believed." The guys that know the smokeless tobacco 
category tell us history clearly shows 
that it is difficult to extend brands from one category to another. 
In order for PM USA to be a significant player in the smokeless tobocco category they'll need to expand through acquisitions (e.g., 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#020508">PM-UST</a>, <a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#020408">PM-Swedish Match</a>).
 Tobacco companies have used various taglines such as for Skoal Dry
 "No Smoke, No Spit, No Boundaries", Camel SNUS "Pleasure for Wherever" and Marlboro SNUS "Flavor Anytime" to try to arouse curiosity. 
Those that have showed any interest are youngsters. Here's a comment from a Metroblogging 
User - Portland, OR where Camel SNUS is being tested. It doesn't take a genius to see what a boon SNUS would be to underage users.
 Heck, you could sit in class with some in your mouth and no one would be the wiser. You could probably hide this stuff from teachers and parents 
pretty easily. ("You SNUS, You Lose" 
posted by PAgent at 1:50pm on January 8, 2007). You wonder if any market research was done at Liggett before making the commitment to enter 
the SNUS market. With the decline in  cigarette sales maybe there was no alternative if you want to stay afloat in the tobacco business.
Ronald Bernstein, the president and chief executive of Liggett, thinks his company will be the first to offer a price-value alternative to consumers. 
Others are already trying to sell SNUS at lower prices without success. Murray Kessler, Chief Executive Officer at UST - the world's leading 
producer of moist smokeless tobacco products - tells us that nine out of 10 smokers that try smokeless reject the product.
As Swedish Match, the world's second largest maker of snuff, has learned in 
Russia a country with no prior SNUS tradition and with 65% of males smoking - it is a matter of marketing an entire new behavior pattern and teaching consumers. 
 In Raleigh, N.C., a test site for Camel SNUS at c-stored 
RJR sales people have been removing SNUS advertisements and replacing them with cigarette 
signage. The growth in the smokeless tobacco area is driven primarily by strong volume and share gains in the lower priced brands —
namely Longhorn (Swedish Match, N.A.), Husky ((99cents Raleigh area, USSTC), and Grizzly (Conwood) NOT PREMIUM.  
In 2006 in the United States cigarettes accounted for more than 90 percent of expenditures on all tobacco products. The expenditure on cigarettes
 in 2005 was $82 billion and for other tobacco products was $6.2 billion (of this the smokeless tobacco category was about $3.7 billion).
 In order for cigarette companies to make up for the loss in
 cigarettes sales they have to aggressively market smokeless products doing everything possible to recruit new users for years to come.
 The Craver article - <a href="Bill_Godshall_Smokefree_PA.jpg">Bill Godshall</a>, the executive director of Smokefree Pennsylvania, a proponent for the 
use of SNUS by inveterate (hard-nosed, long established, deep-rooted) smokers that refuse to quit is now advocating the use of SNUS for all smokers.

 The first session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body 
(INB) on a Protocol on Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products (refers primarily to the smuggling and counterfeiting of
tobacco products, which are the world's most widely smuggled legal consumer
product)took place from 11 to 16 February 2008 in Geneva. The elimination of illicit trade in
 tobacco is one of the key strategies under the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC).  Illicit trade in tobacco products 
contributes to the rise in tobacco consumption and billions of dollars of tax revenue is lost every tax period. The Framework Convention Alliance (created
 to support the development, ratification, and implementation of the WHO FCTC is made up of 
over 300 organizations representing over 100 countries around the world) is urging governments to include the
following provisions in the illicit trade protocol:  An international tracking and tracing system of tobacco products; Anti-money laundering measures;
System of record keeping for all imports and exports of tobacco products; Obligations for tobacco manufacturers to control their supply chain
with penalties for those that fail to do so; The criminalization of participation in illicit trade in various forms; Increased international 
cooperation in the sharing of information and prosecution of offences.
Further negotiations are expected in October and in 2009 before a draft text is presented in 2010 to the 152
 countries which have ratified the FCTC. (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS82961+11-Feb-2008+PRN20080211">Nations

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. — R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. (RJR) is temporarily dropping a promotion that allows smokers to buy some cigarette packs to get
 others free.
<a href="Kool_MKT_Strategy_Ivey_short_biography.html">
Company chairwoman and chief executive Susan Ivey</a> has said the company is looking for overall growth in market share without over-promoting and
 over-discounting its products. The company will test the plan in 25 states in the South and along the Eastern seaboard. The temporary halt 
will run through March 2008. Company officials said it will allow RJR to evaluate promotions in its growth brands Camel, Kool and Pall 
Mall. Analysts tell the Winston-Salem Journal the move is a sign that cigarette companies are looking to save advertising and promotional
 dollars in the shrinking cigarette market. That money can then be directed to sectors with growing customer bases. (The Associated Press, 2/20/2008)

Big Tobacco’s Guinea Pigs: How an Unregulated Industry Experiments on America’s Kids and Consumers..</font></a>
This excellent report has been issued by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, the American Heart Association,
the American Lung Association and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.  More and more tobacco products are being marketed as a result of the
 decline in cigarette smoking and ban on smoking in public places. The report details how the companies manipulate
their products to recruit new youth
users, create and sustain addiction, and discourage users from quitting.  Even though  tobacco use in the leading preventable cause of death
 in this country,
tobacco products are not regulated by any public health agency. As a result tobacco manufacturers can introduce new products, secretly
modify existing products with new designs and ingredients, and make unproven health
claims without regard for the impact on public health. The cornerstone of the pending legislation before the U.S. congress is the requirement that any explicit or implicit
health claim must be evaluated by the FDA on a pre-market basis. This principle applies
to all other products that the FDA regulates and should be applied to tobacco products.

February 21, 2008 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Hefty Fines - Hotels are serious about rooms being smoke free
..</font>   More guests ask for hotel rooms that are free of smoking residue and getting more sensitive about smelling any hint of cigarette smoke
 in non-smoking rooms. Fines can range from $175 to $500 if the smell of tobacco smokes is detected and/or cigarette butts are found in 
your trash. The American Hotel & Lodging Association found that 74% of hotel rooms in the U.S. were nonsmoking in 2006 up from 65% in 2001. 
Several large hotel chains including Marriott International Inc.'s Marriott and Starwood's Westin are 100% nonsmoking in North America. Last 
week, Sheraton, divisions of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., announced all of its North American properties will have a $200 smoking
charge when the brands become 100% nonsmoking at the end of 2008. Walt Disney Co.'s Walt Disney World Resort hotels started applying a new 
smoking charge of as much as $500 in June 2007, when the brand became totally nonsmoking. Some hotels seek out actual physical evidence like photos
of ashes or cigarette butts  before they levy the fine. The Swissotel Chicago awards housekeepers a $10 bonus for every smoker they catch.

February 21, 2008 - <a href="http://www.efluxmedia.com/news_US_Supreme_Court_Declares_Maine_Online_Cigarette_Sales_Law_Null_14286.html"><font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">U.S. Supreme Court Declares Maine Online Tobacco Sales Law Null..</font></a> The U.S. Supreme Court rejected on Wednesday (February 20, 2008)
 a Maine
 law meant to restrict minors’ access to tobacco via Internet or mail by forcing delivery companies to institute a recipient-verification 
service that ensured the buyer is of legal age. “Despite the importance of the public health objective, we cannot agree with Maine that the
 federal law creates an exemption on that basis,” Justice Stephen G. Breyer said. “Many products create ‘public health’ risks … to allow Maine
 directly to regulate carrier services would permit other States to do the same.” 
The law passed Maine’s legislature in 2003, but both a federal appeals court and the U.S. Supreme Court found it inappropriate. 
The federal court had already declared it unconstitutional, and the Supreme Court agreed, unanimously voting against it. The law stipulated that
 carriers should inspect all tobacco packages directed to Maine. In case they failed to do so, carriers such as United Parcel Service 
and Federal Express faced negligence charges for knowingly allowing minors access to the products. Another aspect of the law was that it
 prohibited tobacco shipments into Maine for unlicensed retailers. “Maine’s primary arguments for an exception from the pre-emption – that
 its laws help prevent minors from obtaining cigarettes and thereby protect its citizens’ public health – are unavailing. The federal
 law does not create a public health exception, but, to the contrary, explicitly lists a set of exceptions that do not include public health,” 
the Supreme Court said. Maine was not the only state to support such a law, as 31 other states joined the same efforts to cut down
 on cigarettes deliver over the Internet and most of all, avoid them reaching minors. After taking into consideration all the aspects and 
Maine’s arguments that rejecting the law would only compromise the efforts to prevent minor’s access to cigarettes, the Solicitor General
 said other legislative alternatives should be found to this one. <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0221/p25s04-usgn.html"><font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">In a concurring opinion, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted that the 
case points to an urgent need for federal legislation. "Tobacco use by children and adolescents,
 we have recognized, may be the single most significant threat to public health in the United States," she writes. "But no comprehensive
 federal law currently exists to prevent tobacco
 sellers from exploiting the underage market. Instead, Congress has encouraged state efforts."</font></a> <font size="4">

sharply reduced tobacco sales to youth, and the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement sharply reduced cigarette and smokeless tobacco advertising and promotions that had previously targetted youth.  Meanwhile, tax hikes on cigarettes and other

Swedish Match (Svenska Tandsticks)</a> shares are falling in 2008..</font> The shares of 
Swedish Match AB, the world's second-biggest maker of

The stock has declined 11 percent in 2008 after 11 years of gains. Taxes on snus, or Swedish-style snuff, rose again last month in the 
only European Union country that permits its sale. <a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#021808"> A scientific committee said on Tuesday 
there's not enough evidence to show that snus may help people quit

operating profit, and the bulk of snuff sales comes from Sweden. The country's government raised taxes by 37 percent last month (January 2008)
after doubling them in 2007. The company has forecast an effect similar to that of the last tax rise, which contributed to a 10-percent drop 
 in total sales and a 27-percent slide in operating profit
 in last year's first quarter (2007). Swedish Match and competitors such as Altria Group Inc have banked on demand for smokeless products to fuel sales as 
fewer people buy cigarettes in the United States and western Europe. (

 in New Jersey under a bill (S-613) that was approved by a state Senate panel yesterday. The

<font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">EU 
Scientific Committee Concludes:
 Insufficent Evidence to Lift Ban on SNUS..</font></a> General conclusion of the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR)
is that smokeless tobacco products (STP) are addictive and their use is hazardous to health. STP contain various levels of toxic
substances. Evidence on the effectiveness of STP as a smoking cessation aid is insufficient,
and relative trends in progression from STP into and from smoking differ between countries.
It is thus not possible to extrapolate the patterns of tobacco use from one country where
oral tobacco is available to other countries due to societal, and cultural differences 
the patterns of tobacco use'' to other countries, the committee said. Evidence that the snuff, known as snus, may help
 Swedish smokers stop isn't sufficient to lift an EU ban because it's not possible to extrapolate. For example, overall smoking prevalence 
in Norway, as well as in young Norwegians, has decreased at the same rates in men and women during the last decade,
whereas a marked increase in snus use during this time period has only occurred in young
men. The benefits of lifting a ban would be offset by the risk that consumers who might never have smoked would start using snus, or that consumers 
who quit smoking for the product would continue using it indefinitely, the panel said. Now the European Commission must decide to accept
 or reject the commitee's conclusion. 
<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&amp;sid=a9Wox0nPpTpQ&amp;refer=europe">
"This conclusion implies that there will be no impetus for a change
 in policy for a lifting of the ban," wrote David Hayes, an analyst at Lehman Brothers.</a>

February 17, 2008 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">License Could Be Required to Use Tobacco..</font> Professor Julian Le Grand, Chairman of Health England has come up with a great idea.  Smokers could be forced 
to pay £10 ($19.61 USD) for a permit to buy tobacco
 if a government health advisory body gets its way. 
<a href="#">
Professor Le Grand</a>, a former adviser to ex-PM Tony Blair, said cash raised by 
the proposed scheme would go to the National Health Services. Le Grand  added: "70% of smokers actually want to stop smoking. "So if you
 just make it a little bit more difficult for them to actually re-start or even to start in the first
 place, yes I think it will make a big difference."  He said it was the inconvenience of getting a permit - as much as the cost - 
that would deter people from persisting with the smoking habit. "You've got to get a form, a complex form - the government's good at 
complex forms; you have got to get a photograph. "It's a little bit of a problem to actually do it, so you have got to make a conscious 
decision every year to opt in to being a smoker." A department of health spokeswoman did not rule out such a scheme as part of the next

incidences of cancer and heart disease in adulthood. In December 2007, Nova Scotia became the

Dr.  John 
Britton</a> Professor of Epidemiology at the City Hospital Nottingham. Smoking currently
kills over 100,000 UK citizens each year. Currently 77% of UK smokers want to quit and 78% have tried and failed, mainly because of nicotine
 addiction.
Britton believes that, as a measure of last resort in smokers who have tried all other cessation and substitution options, doctors would be 
justified in suggesting an individual trial of snus. Whether this approach will
 prove effective remains to be seen and desperately needs to be tested in clinical trials, he concludes.  
<a href="alexander_macara.jpg">
Dr. Alexander Macara</a>, President of the National Heart Forum, Bristol argues that this Britton's approach could result in increased use of tobacco. 
He points to evidence that smokeless tobacco is carcinogenic to humans. Studies have also shown increases in the risk of oral and
 pancreatic cancers and heart attacks related to the use of various smokeless tobacco products. Macara fears that, if legalised, snus might
 be taken up by people, especially the young, who might never have smoked tobacco but who may then progress to doing so.

on their place of work. 5.7 per cent were barely affected and the rest were subjected to the equivalent of one to more than ten cigarettes a day.
The results of the study have been published in the Swiss Medical Review. (

February 13, 2008 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">The Word From Dallas - Test Market for Marlboro SNUS..</font> When Marlboro 
SNUS first arrived, it seemed very expensive, but now there are deep discounts and price promotions. A lot of the promotion has been in 
conjunction with Marlboro cigarettes – promotional signs on cigarette displays, samples of snus and coupons in cigarette packs, etc. Sales 
reportedly are not going well.  The product is not appealing to traditional dippers.  Smokers tend to not like it, but some say 
they are ordering true Swedish SNUS on the Internet.  Some say they are using it to quit cigarettes. Others who have tried snus say they 
prefer Camel and the refrigeration for that product gives it a better flavor.  A few stores in the Dallas area are now selling Camel Snus.
In East Texas Camel Snus is showing up in the Nacogdoches area. A teenager indicated that his peers love it because they can
 use it “under the radar” without anyone knowing – which all tobacco control professionals have suspected since this stuff was first introduced.
Some store clerks didn’t even know it is a tobacco product and were unaware that they could not sell it to minors – they thought
 they were breath mints or something. - <font size="4">Many thanks to Darah Waldrip and Betty Boenisch, Tobacco Prevention and Control, Texas

A young asthmatic woman who collapsed and died shortly after arriving for her shift as a waitress at a bar may be the first
 reported death to be reported nationally from acute asthma associated with environmental tobacco smoke (ETS, second hand smoke, passive smoking,
involuntary smoking). The case report (Am J Ind Med 51:111-116,2008) states
 the woman arrived at the bar in Michigan and, according to co-workers, 
seemed happy and healthy. About 15 or 20 minutes later she collapsed and within a few minutes died. "This is the first reported acute
 asthma death associated with work-related ETS," said Kenneth Rosenman, a Michigan State University professor of medicine and 
chief of the Division of Occupational and Environmental Medicine. "Recent studies of air quality and
 asthma among bar and restaurant workers before and after smoking bans support this association."This death dramatizes the need to
 enact legal protections for workers in the hospitality industry from secondhand smoke." We have federal laws that say employers 
have to provide a safe and healthy workplace. This was clearly not a safe and healthy workplace for this employee. "This death dramatizes
 the need to enact legal protections for workers in the hospitality industry from secondhand smoke." 
In the United States, 23 states have already banned smoking in restaurants and bars. A number of other states, including Michigan are considering it.
"Consider that 75 percent of the population doesn't smoke," he said. "Banning smoking could actually serve to increase business. Studies of
restaurants and bars in Boston, New York City, San Francisco and Washington D.C. all show business up since they banned smoking.
 Chicago went smoke free the beginning of this year." (<a href="http://www.news-medical.net/?id=35116">First reported acute asthma death associated with

More on Philip Morris International of the Future..</a>  When Altria's international cigarette unit (PMI) gets its
independence on March 28, 2008, it will move quickly to pursue sales more aggressively without
ties to its American counterpart. Lausanne, Switzerland-based Philip Morris International has said that it would rank as the 
biggest non-governmental cigarette maker in the world, behind the state-owned China National Tobacco. The separation could shield
PMI from U.S. legal and public relations issues, such as pressure by antismoking groups to curb sales in developing countries
 and a <a href="http://tobaccolawcenter.org/documents/lightcigarettes.pdf">U.S. court decision in the 
so-called Kessler case that says PMI cannot use the "light" and "low-tar" labels to market cigarettes.</a>
Philip Morris International, which has operations in 160 countries, has a slew of tobacco products ready to take advantage of growth 
in emerging markets. It is selling the shorter Marlboro Intense in Turkey; a clove-based cigarette called Marlboro Mix 9 in Indonesia; 
Marlboro Filter Plus in South Korea, Russia, Kazakhstan, Romania and Ukraine; and the thicker Marlboro Wides in Switzerland, Germany, Sweden,
France, Japan and Mexico. In Hong Kong, it is selling Marlboro Fresh Mint and Marlboro Crisp Mint. Philip Morris International
reported 2007 gross revenue
of $55.1 billion, compared PMUSA's $18.49 billion. Some related news briefs:

<font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Want To QUIT Smoking - Ask Philip Morris For Help..</font>
Just ask Philip Morris(PM) executives and they'll tell you that the company strives to be socially responsible. The
Chairman and CEO of PM USA Michael E. Szymanczyk will tell you that his company is involved in a number of tobacco prevention activities. 
They even have introduced programs to help smokers who decide to quit be more successful.
<a href="#">Mr. Szymanczyk</a>, 
"While this may seem counterintuitive to some, we are focused on ensuring that consumers who interact with our company have a great experience, 
including when they decide to quit smoking. The evidence indicates that many of our consumers will, at some point, decide 
to stop using our products. We want to be there to help them succeed when they make that decision with the launch of the QuitAssist initiative."
<br><br> 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 70 percent of smokers want to quit. So why isn't PM helping these people 
free themselves of a life of tobacco and nicotine dependence?? Instead PM is rewarding adult smokers for their loyalty to Marlboro cigarettes by 
providing unique experiences for these smokers.
The experiences range from trips to experience Marlboro Country, a trip to Crazy Mountain Ranch in Montana, to  
getting behind the wheel at the Marlboro Racing School, or having an opportunity to ride shotgun 
with a pro-driver or to be invited with tens of thousands of other smokers to go out to your
 local race track as guests to see Marlboro Team Penske compete in the Indy Racing League. All, of these efforts have helped
 contribute to the retaining of market share by Marlboro - the world's most popular cigarette. For every 100 cigarette customers in the U.S. 
approximately
41 (for hispanic smokers this figure is close to 50) of these smokers will ask for Marlboro cigarettes.

Congratulations.. Thailand Joins Developed World With Total Ban On Smoking..</font></a>  Thailand will extend its ban 
on smoking to air-conditioned bars and offices and outdoor markets next month,
 joining major developed countries in a war on tobacco, a leading Thai anti-smoking agency said on Friday. 
Smokers faced a 2,000 baht ($60) fine and owners who fail to enforce the law could be fined 20,000 baht ($600) after the ban takes
 effect on February 17, said the Thailand Health Promotion Institute, which helped push for the law. 
The smokefree law passed in November 2002 banned smoking in covered indoor public places, including air-conditioned restaurants but exempted 
nightclubs and bars. The Health Ministry ban could face opposition from some bar owners, group president
 Hatai Chitanondh said in a statement. "They may be thinking the Health Ministry is ruining their business, kicking away their customers,
 but our research papers show a smoking ban will bring more customers to them," Hatai said. 
<font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">The ban’s extension is being hailed by health
 advocates who say it is another milestone for tobacco control.</font>

<font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">WHO Report on the  Global Tobacco Epidemic 2008..</font></a> The report calls on all countries 
to dramatically increase efforts to prevent young people from beginning to smoke, 
help smokers quit and protect nonsmokers from exposure to second hand smoke. Tobacco use killed 100 million people worldwide in the 20th century 
and could kill 1 billion people in the 21st unless governments act now to dramatically reduce it, the World Health Organization said in a report
released on Thursday, February 7, 2008. With Philip Morris International and other multinational tobacco companies aggressively 
introducing new products and increasingly targeting the developing world, it is
urgent that nations act now to implement the proven solutions identified in this report.
WHO has identified six cost-effective tobacco control policies that have been proven to reduce tobacco use and that every nation should implement.
 Called the MPOWER package by the WHO, <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">these solutions require nations to: Monitor tobacco use and assess the impact of tobacco prevention 
and cessation efforts; Protect everyone from secondhand smoke with laws that require smoke-free workplaces and public places;
Offer help to every tobacco user to quit; Warn and effectively educate every person about the dangers of tobacco use with strong,
 pictorial health warnings and hard-hitting, sustained media campaigns to educate the public;
Enact and enforce comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorships and on the use of misleading terms such
 as ‘light’ and ‘low-tar’; and Raise the price of tobacco products by increasing tobacco taxes.</font> Not one nation has implemented all 
key tobacco control measures despite the fact that governments around the world collect 500 times more money in tobacco taxes each 
year than they spend on anti-tobacco efforts. According to the report, nearly two-thirds of the world's smokers live in 10 countries:
 China, which accounts for nearly 30 percent, India with about 
10 percent, Indonesia, Russia, the United States, Japan, Brazil,

Professor Janet Hoek of Massey University</a>, who led the study, said, "A strong theme of the 20 participants' views

removing the displays would help them to quit.
There is international evidence that retail tobacco displays and other forms of retail marketing increase susceptibility to smoking, the commencement
of smoking by children, and the establishment in children's minds of smoking as a "normal" behaviour. Australian research published last year

February 7, 2008 - <a href="http://www.reynoldsamerican.com/common/ViewPDF.aspx?postID=1264">Vindicating its move 
into smokeless tobacco products, strong sales of moist snuff helped offset
 lower cigarette volumes and higher
 settlement payments at Reynolds American (RAI) for 2007.</a> Conwood has continued to post volume, earnings and margin growth since
 its acquisition in
May 2006. During its first full year as a member of the RAI family, Conwood continued to
lead growth in the moist-snuff category, and gained 0.9 share points in 2007 – with a full-year
share of 26.0 percent. That growth was driven by an additional gain of 1.7 share points on Grizzly, which had a full year
share of shipments of 21.1 percent. Despite higher pricing and heavy competition that
included a number of new market entrants, Grizzly, the moist snuff deep-discount entry, grew at more than twice the industry rate.
In 2007, Grizzly captured well over 40 percent of all volume growth in the moist-snuff
category. Conwood’s leading premium entry – Kodiak – experienced volume and share declines last
year in the face of heavy promotion by competitive brands. Camel Snus, represents the brand’s first foray into a new category:
smoke-free tobacco products that are also spitless. Camel Snus provides adults with a
discreet way to enjoy tobacco pleasure. <font size="4">In 2007, R.J. Reynolds expanded its test of Camel
Snus to a total of eight markets, and the company plans to expand into additional markets in

 led by the growing popularity of Kool’s XL styles. Kool XL, a smoother, wider cigarette, was
introduced in 2006 in 27 states. Last year, the company expanded Kool XL nationally, along
with a new, milder style called XL Blue. That helped Kool maintain its
overall market share of 3.1 percent despite intense competition in the menthol market and the
above-average price increases we’ve taken to further strengthen Kool’s profitability.”
The 3rd growth brand, Pall Mall, continues to gain share on the strength of its
positioning as a great product at a great price. Pall Mall remained focused on volume and
margin growth in 2007 as the brand added another 0.3 share points, for a full-year share of
2.1 percent. Filippe Goossens of Credit Suisse noted that cigarette volumes declined faster
 than expected, and growth rates for the smokeless segment decelerated.

 UST is the world leader in smokeless tobacco products; their popular brands Copenhagen and Skoal are each worth more than $1 billion at retail.
In the fourth-quarter of 2007 UST profits posted a 1.4% rise, but suffered a decline in market share for its core smokeless tobacco business.

Altria will be focused on U.S. tobacco markets..</font>With the spin off of Philip Morris International the parent company of Philip Morris, Altria, will become 
a company focused on various tobacco markets in the United States and move its headquarters to Richmond from New York. With cigarette 
smoking steadily declining among Americans, Altria has turned its focus to 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#121207b">
cigars</a> and various types of chewing tobacco.
The challenge for the company, which will now be entirely based and operating in Virginia, will be to move into other 
tobacco businesses that are still growing. Philip Morris is spending up to $100 million to refurbish and expand the York plant (abandoned in 2004 and 
will be the focal point of future growth for the remaining assets of Altria) adding 180 high-paying jobs. Following 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#062607a">
closures announced in North Carolina last year</a>, 
the only other Philip Morris facilities left in the country are in the Richmond area and York County.
The Marlboro Snus test has gone well and will expand in March to Indianapolis, the same market where Taboka did not perform well 
and was pulled. The traditional Marlboro chew also garnered "encouraging initial consumer and trade response," the company said, and will
 expand into counties around Atlanta.
"Marlboro's exceedingly-well-positioned to capture growth in this category," said Louis C. Camilleri, Altria chief executive.
The company's projections for how it will perform in 2008 reveal some optimism about its faith in the chewing tobacco and cigar strategy.
 Altria's domestic cigarette sales dropped 4.6 percent in 2007, but the company expects earnings to grow from 9 percent to 11 percent in 2008.

Altria Announces Spin-off of Philip Morris International Inc..</font></a>  Altria Group, Inc. today issued its 2007 
full-year and fourth-quarter results and announced the spin-off of Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI). Louis C. Camilleri, Chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer of Altria. “The PMI spin-off and related actions position our international and domestic tobacco businesses 
for future success as stand-alone companies with unique and formidable strengths,
including leading brands, strong cash flow, experienced leadership and solid growth prospects.” The Board of Directors of Altria voted today 
to authorize the spin-off of 100% of the shares of Philip Morris International (PMI) to Altria’s shareholders - the distribution will be made 
on March 28, 2008. Altria’s Board of Directors and management determined that PMI’s separation from Altria will enhance growth and 
shareholder value by providing the following benefits: An improved focus on the different market dynamics, competitive frameworks, challenges 
and opportunities that Altria and PMI face; A more optimal and efficient capital allocation to enhance shareholder value, coupled with greater 
financial flexibility, including an increase in the combined debt capacity of Altria and PMI; Greater transparency leading to the elimination 
of the sum-of-the-parts discount under which Altria’s common stock has typically traded; A significant reduction in corporate overheads,
including the closure of Altria’s corporate headquarters in New York; The creation of a potential acquisition currency in the form of more 
focused equity that neither of Altria’s tobacco subsidiaries has had available prior to the spin-off; and A tighter alignment of compensation 
and rewards with the performance of each entity. Louis C. Camilleri will serve as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of PMI following
 his resignation from posts at Altria. <a href="#">Michael E. Szymanczyk</a>, will serve as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Altria.

With Shrinking America Cigarette Sales Philip Morris USA More Dependent on the Smokeless Tobacco Market..</font> Altria Group Inc.,
 the biggest U.S. tobacco company, is becoming more dependent on shrinking 
American cigarette sales for profit as the spinoff of its international division approaches. U.S. cigarette sales are falling,
 pushing the maker of the top-selling Marlboro brand to invest in the $3.7 billion smokeless tobacco market, which is growing 6 percent a year
(total price/value segment continues to drive overall category growth in moist snuff not premium - TW). Chief Executive Officer Louis Camilleri 
may announce tomorrow plans to split off the 
international unit in March 2008, turning up pressure on its Philip Morris USA to expand beyond cigarettes. U.S. producers shipped 6.8 percent
 fewer cigarettes in December than a year earlier, twice the rate of decline for all of 2007. Higher prices and smoking bans may
 be accelerating the drop, said Judy Hong, a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst.

Tomorrow Altria Board Expected to Announce Decision to Split Philip Morris International (PMI) From

something that has been in the works for years,” said <a href="Bonnie_Herzog_2.jpg">Bonnie Herzog</a>, an analyst at Citigroup. “To me, it’s a done deal.”  The move would 
free the tobacco giant's international operations of legal and public-relations headaches in the U.S. that have 
<a href="Altria_Tobacco_Ne_Revenue_US_International.gif">  hindered its growth</a>.   
“It allows PMI to become much more free to pursue growth opportunities,” 
Ms. Herzog said. The Altria Group would probably remain as a holding 
company for Philip Morris USA and the company’s 29 percent stake in SABMiller, the beer company, she said. Some of the new cigarette products 
include: 
<a href="#">
Marlboro Intense</a> - shrunken down by about a half inch, and offers smokers seven potent puffs apiece, versus the average of eight
 or so milder draws. The idea behind Intense is to appeal to customers who, due to indoor smoking bans, want to dash outside for a quick 
nicotine hit but don't always finish a full-size cigarette. With the

said, “We’ve been really pleased with the initial reaction to the product by adult moist-smokeless-tobacco consumers in the Atlanta test market." 
Initailly with the MST launch Modi was postive but after 2-months things have changed,
 his comment: “Marlboro MST’s share position has

a resurgence following
 an initial drop in share. Marlboro SNUS, currently in test market
 in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, builds on the brand equity of Marlboro cigarettes and comes 
in four varieties: Rich, Mild, Mint and Spice. "We are pleased with the initial reaction by adult consumers, wholesalers and retailers to 
Marlboro Snus in the Dallas/Fort Worth test market

(Q4 2007 Earnings Call - 1/24/2008); Marlboro snuff;
 when Philip Morris USA announced an Atlanta rollout into our category last August 2007
 there was much speculation that the competitive dynamics would shift
 for both us and the category. While we appreciated investors concern we believe the street had underestimated Copenhagen and Skoal’s brand
equities (each worth more than $1 billion at retail - TW). Clearly Marlboro is a great cigarette brand. That said, <font size="4">history clearly shows 
that it is difficult to extend brands from one one category to another</font> particularly in one such as ours where the existing brand equities 
are so ubiquitous. The Copenhagen and Skoal equities are proving their loyal consumer following and while it is still early our brands are 
as strong as ever for perspective UST’s premium brands in Atlanta are growing at a 3.4% rate following Marlboro’s launch which is above the 
national average and category growth has remained strong. We were able to achieve this with a response to their launch that was measured and 
in no case included lowering prices. Furthermore, this was achieved despite the fact that Marlboro promoted down to a deep discount level of 
$1.49 a can. Said simply, what we see in the marketplace so far is similar to what has been written by several sell side analyst. So, while again
 it is early, we agree that this new entry is not a game changer for the snuff category and we remain confident in our ability to keep growing.

Still sucking our youngsters in..</font></a> This is National Non-Smoking Week in Canada. 
Almost 200,000 Quebecers quit smoking last year but the tobacco companies continue to lure 
youngsters with gimmicks like flavored cigarettes (tinged with alcohol and food flavors), the province's director of public health, Dr. Alain Poirier
said. Consumption of cigars and cigarillos is on the increase among high-school students. In 2006, about one student in five (22 per cent)
 tried one of these products. The flavored cigarettes can be bought individually or in slickly designed packs of four. A single smoke sells 
for $1.50 plus tax. <font size="4">The tobacco companies are looking for ways to attract youth, which is perverse, because (by law) they aren't allowed
 to sell tobacco products to young people.</font>  
Another product, called snus, which is placed between the gum and upper lip but not chewed or swallowed, is being produced by Imperial Tobacco Canada.
Quebec actress Mireille Deyglun, spokeswoman for the anti-smoking week, knows first hand the dangers of tobacco. Her father, brother
and two cousins died of lung cancer, and she smoked from the age of 12 before quitting in 1996 at the age of 37. A study by Canadian researchers published last August concluded that the risk 
of heart attack was equally serious whether tobacco is smoked, chewed or used in a water pipe. ("Still Sucking 'em in" by Sue Montgomery,

January 22, 2008 - It's Illegal for Women to Smoke in Public..  Profile America ---  You may think the debate over smoking is fairly
 recent. But 100 years ago this week, the New York City council passed an ordinance that made it illegal for women to smoke in public. The
ordinance was the result of a campaign by the National Anti-Cigarette League, the first to use the term "coffin nails" for cigarettes. At the time, a number
 of cities had banned smoking, along with the states of Arkansas, Iowa, Idaho, and Tennessee. All of these laws were revoked by 1917, since
 they were not only difficult to enforce, but added to the allure of smoking. Now, just under 21 percent of adults in the U.S. currently smoke. 
The highest proportion is in Kentucky, at 28 percent. The lowest is Utah at 11 percent.
You can find these and more facts about America from the U.S. Census Bureau on the Web at www.census.gov.

Festival cigarette stalls banned in youth crackdown..</a> New South Wales, Australia is outlawing cigarette stalls at music festivals
 and banning fruit- and confectionary-flavoured cigarettes in a bid to stop young people from smoking. 
Retailers face fines of up to $5,500 for selling the flavoured cigarettes from today and public health officers are allowed to inspect premises.
The new laws will outlaw mobile tobacco vendors, which set up designated smoking tents at youth festivals. Assistant Health Minister Verity Firth 
says the vendors are dangerous because they attract young people. "In these tents, there are often DJs designed to attract young people into
 the tents and attract promoters with the cigarette brand," she said. "In the olden days, they would have been called cigarette girls." But Ms Firth
 says confectionary is the most dangerous marketing ploy used by tobacco companies to target young people. "Teenagehood (sic) is a key life
 phase for starting smoking," she said. "Our surveys show that 80 per cent of smokers started smoking during their teenage years and it's
 an incredibly hard habit to quit." (abc.net.au, 1/18/2008) <font size="4">Click on image to enlarge..</font>

Ban the Sale of Tobacco from Pharmacies..</font></a> New York State Assemblyman Sam Hoyt has introduced a bill that would ban
 the sale of tobacco from pharmacies. "In light of the overwhelming evidence of the harmful nature of cigarette smoking on one’s health
 and the astronomical public health cost posed by tobacco products it is contradictory and counter-intuitive to sell such products 
in any establishment whose purpose is to provide remedies to health problems," Hoyt said in a statement. Because stores such as 
Tops (large grocery store chain mainly in Western New York) and Wal-Mart operate pharmacies on their premises, they would be covered under the law.
 The theory is that if cigarettes are taken out of enough stores it will “de-normalize” the product, as it was put by Jim Ver Steeg of the 
American Heart Association. And by doing that, 
the logic goes, it would reduce the sale of tobacco, fewer of us would use it and we would all be happier and healthier.

January 14, 2008 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Our Kids are still our number one priority..</font>The Standing Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR), received the assignment
 from the European Union (EU) Commission to investigate the health risks of smokeless tobacco products, including Swedish snus. The committee presented
 a preliminary report at the beginning of July, 2007  which was based on a review of a large 
number of scientific studies and reports, and particular attention was paid to Swedish experience of snus. 
<a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article1785028.ece">
Traditional cigarette companies 
 such as British American Tobacco (BAT), Reynolds American, Imperial Tobacco and Philip Morris that have started to diversify
 into smokeless products anxiously wait for the final decision.</a> But why should the ban be lifted - the major problem that
 existed in 1990 still exists 
today. Small bags of tobacco were banned in Britain in 1990 after the US Smokeless Tobacco company tried
 to introduce sweet-flavored tobacco
capsules called 
<a href="Skoal_bandits.jpg">
Skoal Bandits </a>. It was feared that they would appeal to children. The ban was supplanted by EU-wide legislation in May, 1992. 
The legislation prohibited the placing on the market of tobacco for oral use;  the primary reason "...products for oral use will be used 
above all by young people, thus leading to nicotine
 addiction..." . (The prohibition was introduced by Directive 92/41/EEC amending Directive 89/622/EEC.)
However, as we all know Sweden negotiated an exception - these people have been using Snus for over 200 years; it's a tradition--it's part of 
their culture. The legal age to purchase tobacco products in Britain was just raised from 16 to 18 - 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#010808">
why wasn't the age raise to 21</a> - 
we all know the majority of smokers start smoking before the age of 21. 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#111007a">
The art of snusing</a>  - the placement of the portioned bag  between 
the upper lip
 and gum and then sucking while the bag is totally stationary  - is not an easy task to master.  Public health proponents of smokeless  tobacco 
tell us they are targeting inveterate (hard-nosed, long established, deep-rooted) smokers but as tobacco companies are finding 
at test sites in the U.S. 
it's not an easy sell. <a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#120507b">The Chief Operating Officer of this 
company, Murray Kessler has stated that "Nine out of 10 smokers that try smokeless still reject the product."</a> Professor John Britton,
chairman of the Royal College of Physicians Tobacco Advisory Group,
 a  proponent of SNUS as a harm reduction solution has concluded 
<a href="http://www.smokefree.org.uk/wwwdev/news_article.asp?id=53">
"It's their
(tobacco companies) job to sell as much tobacco as possible,
so they will be targeting non-smokers rather 
than current ones, that's the worry."</a> Those that will give Snus a chance are young adults and kids that want to be young adults; 
as a result we'll end up with another generation of nicotine addicts never able to achieve their full potential. 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#111307b">
In Norway (not an EU member)
to hook kids on Snus you find starter kits with various Snus packets flavored with various fruit flavors. </a>
As Swedish Match learned in 
Russia (Snus product called Click)
with no prior Snus tradition  - it is a matter of marketing an entire new behavior pattern and teaching consumers. You would think, that if a tobacco 
users have to change their behavior, they might as well give up tobacco products and live longer.

Tobacco (MST) that was introduced into the Atlanta test market in October 2007.(TobaccoWatch.org) On January 10, 2008, Davenport & Company, a Virginia investment firm, 
 released a 
research report analyzing the recent test launch of Altria's (NYSE: MO) MST. The price for a can of Marlboro Moist Smokeless Tobacco was 
initially set at $3, a dollar cheaper than either of 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#122107b">
UST's popular brands</a> -- Copenhagen and Skoal (each worth more than $1 billion at retail - TW)
-- which are consistently priced at $4 per can 
in the area. As Davenport's checks went around to different convenience stores in the Atlanta test market, they surprisingly discovered that
 many stores had to lower
 their prices on cans of the Marlboro brand to $1.50. The retailers said they had to cut the price on the Marlboro brand as the product 
was either already old or just about to be, and needed to be sold or thrown away. 
Almost every retailer (Wal-Mart was the exception) that was testing the Marlboro product said they saw noticeably slow sales, despite
 the smokeless tobacco product being brand new. Most retailers also noted a strong brand loyalty for UST's products: clerks would specifically
 ask customers buying smokeless tobacco products if they would try the new Marlboro brand for a cheaper price, but the majority of the consumers
 would respond 'no' and ask again for their favorite brand. 
Going on, retailers noted to Davenport's checks that they had seen little or no return buyers out of the consumers who did try the 
Marlboro Moist Smokeless Tobacco. In fact, one store said it had not sold a single can of the Marlboro product for two weeks, at a time when
 UST brand sales remained solid. Initially, consumers seemed some-what interested in the Marlboro product and would at least ask questions about 
it, but as the trial period went on, fewer and fewer buyers of tobacco would inquire about the new Marlboro product.

that the companies were negligent and sold defective products, which will apply in the individual cases. Plaintiffs' lawyers said the total
 number of claims filed against the industry may reach 10,000. Philip Morris, the biggest U.S. cigarette maker, faces new Florida suits filed 
on behalf of about 1,700 dead and injured smokers so far, 
said spokesman John Sorrells. Reynolds American Inc.'s R.J. Reynolds unit has received claims from about 1,650 plaintiffs, spokesman 
David Howard said. There is some overlap in the companies' tallies because plaintiffs who smoked more than one brand may name several 
manufacturers as defendants. Plaintiffs' lawyers are hoping that Florida trial courts interpret the ruling to mean they must do little 
more than prove the amount of their clients' damages. (Bob Van Voris Bloomberg.com, 1/10/2008)

January 11, 2008 - Philip Morris USA (PM)To Also Test Marlboro Snus In Indianapolis.. Altria Group Inc.'s (MO) Philip Morris USA said it will
be introducing Marlboro Snus into an additional test market in the Indianapolis area. The cigarette maker said Marlboro Snus is a tobacco
 pouch product designed for adult smokers who are interested in smokeless tobacco alternatives to cigarettes. The company said it 
is "pleased" with the initial reaction by adult consumers, wholesalers and retailers to Marlboro Snus in the Dallas/Fort Worth test market.
Marlboro Snus will be available in the Indianapolis area in March, 2008.

January 10, 2008 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Encouraging smokeless tobacco use is not only a dangerous tactic
 in the drive to reduce smoking rates, but scientifically unproven as well..</font> "This approach puts us at great risk of repeating the fiasco
 of ‘Light’ and ‘Mild’ cigarettes," says Michael Thun, MD, ACS Vice President of Epidemiology and Surveillance Research. "There is no evidence that smokers will switch to smokeless tobacco products and give up smoking. In fact, the tobacco companies market these products as a ‘bridge’ that provides smokers with nicotine in settings where smoking is prohibited. Any product that encourages smokers to postpone quitting will increase rather 
than decrease their risk of lung cancer, as was the case with ‘Light’ and ‘Mild’ cigarettes." Thun adds another problem with promoting smokeless
 tobacco over cigarettes is the danger of youth uptake. "Now that all of the large tobacco companies have introduced their own lines 
of smokeless products, their marketing strategies will inevitably target susceptible adolescents. They have already introduced flavors such
 as apple, peach, and mint." (

 to be protected from the onslaught of the tobacco industry," he said. As of October 1, 2007 the legal minimum age at which tobacco can be bought

<b>Dr. Wayne Hall</b></a>, a professor of public health policy at
 the University of Queensland, and his colleagues 
argue that SNUS may be effective in helping some of Australia's 2.9 million smokers give up smoking. Hall feels that with legislative changes
smokeless tobacco could be sold under the counter in pharmacies and doctors and quit lines could encourage inveterate (hard-nosed, long-established,
 deep-rooted) 
smokers to make the switch 
"as a way of reducing the harm caused by their tobacco use." How does the good doctor know that inveterate smokers will learn the 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#111007a">

Unites States Smokeless Tobacco Company has been trying to market a SNUS product, Revel,  since 2001 with little success. The Chief Operating Officer of this 
company, Murray Kessler has stated that "Nine out of 10 smokers that try smokeless still reject the product." Some tobacco companies are

 SNUS products (e.g., Camel SNUS, Marlboro SNUS, Skoal Dry) in the U.S. have had very little success.  Dr. Lars E. Rutqvist, the
 Vice President for Scientific Affairs at 
<a href="swedish_match_more.html">
Swedish Match</a> (the world's second largest maker of snuff and chewing tobacco and market leader in Sweden -
 volume share of 90% at the end of 2006) tells us the drive in snus sales 
in Sweden has been in response to the smoking ban rather than the perceived advantage to user’s health. Compared to tobacco smoking very little 
is known about smokeless tobacco. Dr. John 
Britton, probably the foremost proponent in the British Commonwealth for the use of SNUS agrees that more research into the long-term 
health effects of SNUS would be helpful. (TobaccoWatch.org)

 The only people who will be considered

 and further, that they will not use such products while they work for the county. Violators of the policy can be fired. Current tobacco users
 are exempted, although they will be offered programs to help them quit. So as it stands, any smoker hired last Monday or earlier is in the clear,
 but a tobacco consumer who wants a job now should just steer clear. County officials say they trying to cut down on health insurance costs by
 not hiring people who use tobacco. The county is not alone. The city of Ocala, FL instituted a similar policy effective Oct. 1, 2007 and 
local governments in Florida have been able to legally turn aside smokers as prospective employees since 1995. Related news brief:
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#081307">August 13, 2007</a>. 
<u>From SNUS.biz:</u> Companies concerned about paying high health insurance premiums are hesitant to employ people that smoke or use other tobacco
 products. A healthcare benefits company fired four of its employees for refusing to take a test that determines whether they smoke cigarettes.
 Weyco Inc., a health benefits administrator based in Okemos, MI adopted this policy January 1, 2005 that allows employees to be fired if they
 smoke even if the smoking happens after business hours or at home. The company cites concerns over rising healthcare costs for those that smoke.
 "Wyco Inc. is a non-smoking company that strongly supports its employees in living healthy lifestyles."(TheBostonChannel.com, 1/25/2005). 
Effective January 1, 2002, as a part of our public health policy, and because of the known effects tobacco use has on our community,
 Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department does not hire applicants who use tobacco. Smokers at Scott's Miracle-Gro Co. won't even be able to do
 that much longer. In October 2006, the Marysville, OH based company will begin randomly testing employees and giving pink slips to those who test
 positive for nicotine. The company announced the ultimatum in November, saying it was giving employees a year to quit, and offered to help 
with smoking-cessation programs. Scott's officials say it's part of a larger effort to help their
 employees become healthier (Clock ticking down for smokers at Scott's Miracle-Grow, Susan Deutschle, Business First of Columbus, April 14, 2006).
 More and more tobacco use is being looked upon

Indianapolis in July 2006) and Marlboro MST was introduced into test market in the the Atlanta area in October 2007. What's the difference in these 
snuff tobacco products??  With MST instead of chewing on tobacco, a small clump (also called dip) is ‘pinched ‘ out of the tin and placed
between the lower or upper lip and gums. The tobacco clump rests on the inside of the mouth for approximately 20-30 minutes. The 
presence of the clump inside the mouth produces excess saliva. This is typically spit out on the ground or in a bottle because the 
swallowing can cause irritation of the esophagus, nausea and vomiting. Taboka and Marlboro Snus pouches are similar to those SNUS 
products sold in Sweden; meaning among other things that they are smoke-free, pasteurized and also typically spit-free. These products usually
 contains less water and salt then MST products.
 There is a

technique to master in placing the SNUS</a> in a particular location at the front of the mouth between the upper lip

December 29, 2007 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Illinois Goes Smoke Free on January 1, 2008.</font>. At the stroke of midnight on New Year’s Eve, Illinois will ban virtually all indoor
 smoking in public spaces, including bars and restaurants. Chicago restricted indoor smoking in 2005, and so far this year, the
city has received only 119 smoking-related complaints, the public health department said. Under the Smoke-Free Illinois Act,
 just about the only places left where you can smoke indoors will be private cars and homes. Smoking will be banned
 in offices, factory floors, stores, private clubs, prisons, bowling alleys, dormitories, stadiums, casinos, elevators and
restrooms. Smoking also will be banned within 15 feet of entrances, exits and windows. Smoking will still be allowed in 
private rooms in nursing homes, in up to 25 percent of hotel rooms and in tobacco shops
and hookah bars that don’t serve food or alcohol. Smokers could be fined as much as $250. Businesses could be fined at least
 $250 for the first violation and at least $2,500 for a third violation within a year. A 2005 survey found that
 72 percent of Illinois adults said smoking should
be banned from work and 73 percent said it should be banned from restaurants. ("

products to increase January 1, 2008..</font> The Wisconsin cigarette tax will increase from 77 cents per pack to $1.77 on New Year’s Day. It will be 
the 12th highest in the nation. New Jersey has the highest tax at $2.28 per pack. The Legislative Fiscal Bureau predicts
 Wisconsin’s cigarette tax collections will increase almost 80 percent in just three years — from $296 million in 2006

With more hookah bars popping up, experts warn about the potential dangers of tobacco..</font></a> Many 
hookah (Sheesha or Shisha, Narghile, Waterpipe) fans contend that drawing smoke through water removes some of the harmful chemicals. Scientists, however, say 
that although the hookah might filter out some irritants, the smoke nevertheless contains high levels of nicotine,
 carbon monoxide and other toxic chemicals. The potential risks, of hookah smoking has taken on added relevance as
 hookah bars have begun to sprout up across the U.S. in recent years. There are more than 400 hookah cafes, according to an 
online database of hookah bars. There is a growing popularity of hookah bars, especially among 18- to 24-year-olds. Dr. David Burns,
 professor emeritus of medicine at the University of California, San Diego, "and there is evidence that it contains
 many of the toxic constituents of tobacco. And you may get them in higher doses than you would from smoking cigarettes because 
of the very large volume of smoke that you ingest." Hookah sessions typically last 20 to 80 minutes, and the mildness of the
 smoke allows for deeper inhalations. A WHO advisory issued in 2005 reports that during one 40- to 45-minute hookah session,
 a smoker could, in theory, inhale the equivalent of 100 cigarettes. See related news briefs: directly below and

 sheesha (waterpipe) smoking, experts like Dr. Ahmad al-Mulla, the director of the stop smoking clinic in Doha - the capital of 
Qatar, warn the practice is no less harmful than cigarette smoking. The smoke that comes out of sheesha contains numerous toxicants
known to cause lung cancer and heart diseases, by delivering the addictive nicotine. A comment from a user: Mureno, a
22-year old student - "I am truly re-living the Arabian Nights" whose favorite tobacco flavor is 'double apple.' The tobaccos come in  assorted 
flavors such as apple, mint, chocolate and grape. The law banning public smoking of tobacco or its derivatives was implemented
in 2002 but cafes offering sheeshas did not fall under the category. According to Dr. al-Mullah the authorities are not issuing 
any more licenses for new cafes offering sheesha (shisha). There's a widespread notion among youngsters that the practice of 
sheesha smoking is relative which is NOT true.  ("Sheesha as harmful as cigarette, say experts" by Sarmad Qazi, Gulf Times, 12/27/2007)

December 25, 2007 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Snuff Is NOT 'Safer' Substitute For Cigarettes..</font>
 Dr. Stephen S. Hecht, an internationally 
recognized expert on cancer-causing agents in tobacco and the pathways by which they cause cancer, has completed a 20-year review 
(in the January 1, 2008 issue of 
<a href="American_Chemical_Society.jpg">
American Chemical Society's</a> Section on Chemical Research in Toxicology) off scientific research on tobacco and cancer challenges the idea that moist snuff — increasingly popular
 in the United States — can be a safer substitute for cigarette smoking. 
The paper, which covers the broad range of research on cancer induced by tobacco, points out that smokeless tobacco,
 a known cause of oral cancer, is contaminated with levels of cancer-causing 
<a href="nitrosamines.html">
nitrosamines</a> that are generally 1,000 times 
greater than those found in any other consumer product. Despite health warning labels on packages of smokeless tobacco 
and a ban on electronic advertising, sales of snuff have continued to increase, the paper states. 
“In the past several years, a new concept has emerged,” the paper notes. “Responsible members of the tobacco control
 community support the idea of using ‘low nitrosamine’ moist snuff as a substitute for cigarette smoking. The rationale 
for this is that moist snuff is demonstrably less carcinogenic in humans, and less toxic in other ways, because it lacks
 the combustion products.” However, moist snuff products still contain significant levels of carcinogens, and users should 
stop, rather than switch from one risky product to another, the paper advises. (

two studies from the University of Minnesota Transdisciplinary Tobacco Use Research Center that favored their tobacco lozenge

One study examined the  potential health risks and benefits of potential harm reduction products. Tobacco-specific carcinogen uptake
 was greater from Exalt (SNUS product by Swedish Match) than from the MNL (medicinal nicotine lozenge), and was comparable
 between the MNL and Ariva. Physiological effects and subjective
 effects on withdrawal and craving were comparable among Exalt, Ariva, and the MNL. Ariva was preferred over the MNL, which was 
preferred over Exalt. It was concluded that with the exception of medicinal nicotine products, low-nitrosamine ST products have the greatest
 potential to result in reduced toxicant exposure compared with other combustible reduced exposure products and have promise
for reducing individual risk for disease. (

Bush vetoed the 2nd bill expanding the State Children's Health

physicians a 0.5 percent rate increase when they treat the elderly and disabled in Medicare. Physicians
 had been scheduled to take a 10 percent cut. The reprieve for doctors will last until June 30. The House leadership has 
scheduled a vote for January 23, 2008 to attempt to override that veto. It appears that the House will not be able
 to muster the 2/3 vote necessary to override the veto. Late last week there was talk regarding a short term extension of the current SCHIP program through March 31, 2008. 
However, on December 17, negotiators agreed to extend the current SCHIP program through March 31, 2009 with a small
increase in funding necessary for the states to maintain their current enrollment through that date.

 a private tobacco company and a market leader in machine-made cigars, would offer several benefits to Reynolds American Inc.
 including a quick market share grab of the growing cigar industry, substantial cost savings and synergies with its Conwood 
and Lane subsidiaries, an opportunity to truly become a "total" tobacco company and to become a bigger player in the growing 
U.S. cigar category than PM USA, said Herzog. An acquisition of Swisher would give Reynolds the opportunity to become 
the second-largest domestic cigarette manufacturer, the second-largest smokeless manufacturer and the largest 
machine-made cigar manufacturer, she added. With U.S. cigarette volumes consistently declining, and Reynolds 
inability to take its famous cigarette brands outside the United States given the sale of these trademarks, 
"we believe an acquisition of Swisher provides Reynolds with a growth opportunity within the domestic tobacco sector,
 much like Conwood, considering cigar volumes have been growing, even despite limited promotion of the segment."

December 14, 2007 -  <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Coupons for Free Cans of SNUS Readily Available..</font> - 
Initial acceptance of SNUS has been poor. Tobacco companies
 are in agreement for SNUS to catch on and be a strong seller it's going to require
more public awareness and education. As part of the plan in bars patrons are giving a free coupon to try SNUS or after a few
 drinks and you express interst in SNUS they'll mail you coupons - this is 
for Marlboro SNUS and Camel SNUS in the Dallas, TX area. In addition, in the same area of the U.S.,  you can find  
Camel SNUS coupons tucked away in Sunday 
newspapers and free weekly publications  that can be exchanged at stores for a tin full of smokeless, spitless, tobacco 
pouches FREE. A local dentist Kyle McCracken believes the tobacco company is marketing the product to younger consumers who do
 not currently use tobacco products. "It appears in the format that they're using, it is appealing to younger adults and kids," 
Dr. McCracken noted that Camel Snus is sold in a tin container like Altoids mints. "To me, that resembles candy," he said. 
"It seems to be that it is more appealing to the younger people." The Camel Snus Web site suggests using its product 
"at a concert, right in front of security, on a jet from Miami to L.A. or at a bar or club.  Critics of Snus—like dental hygienist
 Lynnette Gonzalez—believe the tobacco industry is targeting a new generation of customers by creating a devious way to get
 kids addicted without teachers or parents knowing it. They make it look fun," Gonzalez said. "Some of their advertisements
 say 'bars' or 'when you're riding in cars' and stuff.""We do not want youth to use these products," Howard said. 
"We do not want to communicate with youth." David Howard, a spokesman for R.J. Reynolds, states that ads are targeting only 
one audience: Adult tobacco consumers. "We do not want youth to use these products," Howard said - BUT THEY ARE. "We're fighting, it seems,
 like a no-win battle here trying to get people to stop using tobacco products," Gonzalez said, "and they're giving them out for 
free." (<a href="http://www.wfaa.com/sharedcontent/dws/wfaa/latestnews/stories/wfaa071213_wz_snus.105c0352.html">

Insurance Program (SCHIP)...</font> 
Wednesday (12/12/2007)was the deadline for Bush to act or let the bill become law.
This is his second rejection of a bipartisan effort in Congress to increase funding for the program. Bush's statement said: 
"This bill does not put poor children first, and it moves our country's health care system in the wrong direction," 
Ultimately, our nation's goal should be to move children who have no health insurance to private coverage, not to move children
who already have private health insurance to government coverage." Bush urged Congress to extend the program at its current 
funding level before lawmakers leave Washington for their holiday break. Congressional leaders said now will try to extend the SCHIP
program into 2008 in basically its current form. The House  voted 211-180 late yesterday to put off until January 23, 2008 a vote 
on overriding the president's veto. (<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/12/12/national/main3612808.shtml?source=RSSattr=U.S._3612808">

December 12, 2007 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Use of smokeless tobacco is a risk factor for cigarette smoking..
</font> The use of smokeless tobacco(ST) in the 7th and 9th grades is a significant 
risk factor for subsequent smoking even when controlling for other factors. This study assessed the risk of smoking uptake
 over 2 years in adolescent boys (in grades 7 and 9) who had used 
ST. We used logistic regression to determine whether the odds of adolescent boys taking up regular
 smoking over a period of 2 years were greater among initial nonsmokers who used ST, compared with nonusers of ST, after 
accounting for six well-established predictors of smoking. Initiation of weekly smoking 2 years after baseline was associated 
with ST use at baseline, even after including dichotomous measures of parent, sibling, or close friend smoking; 
low academic grades; 30-day alcohol use; and a scale measure of deviant behavior. With these other predictors included 
in the model, the odds ratio for the association of ST use with weekly smoking after 2 years was strong 
and significant (OR = 2.55, 95% CI 1.45-4.47, p&lt;.001).

December 12, 2007 - Altria completes Middleton acquisition.. 
The Altria Group said yesterday (12/11/2007)that, having received regulatory clearance, it had completed the acquisition of John Middleton,
 a leading manufacturer of machine-made large cigars, from privately held Bradford Holdings.(Tobacco Reporter) Cigarette
 consumption has been decreasing for more than 25 years and slipped about 2% between in 2006 year and in 2005. Machine-made
cigars shipments, however, grew 4% between 2003 through 2007, per Altria. Middleton, which produces cigars in King of Prussia 
and Limerick, Pa., saw operating income grow at a 10% compound annual rate during the same period. Black & Mild brand generates
23% of machine-made large cigar sales. The deal, which was the biggest in Altria’s 105-year history, is expected to close by
 the end of the year.

Smoking Device has Quit fuming..</a> Philip Morris will launch Australia's first hand-held electronic smoking device from its South Yarra 
concept store today (12/11/2007) in a move that has infuriated anti-tobacco groups. Unlike normal cigarettes, the device

Fiona Sharkie, Executive Director of Quit Victoria said the Heatbar had been a "miserable failure" overseas. She accused Philip Morris of deliberately targeting young people

 tobacco companies ended a voluntary ban on advertising in mass-market publications. The ads have also appeared in various free

Philip Morris to 'Unleash the Beast'in 2008?</a> - Citigroup tobacco analyst 
<a href="Bonnie_Herzog_2.jpg"> Bonnie Herzog</a> said during 
CSPNetwork's Tobacco Update CyberConference on Wednesday (12/5/2007)that there are some exciting things that could happen 
in the next year or two. Kicking off the excitement will be the spinning off of Philip Morris International from Altria Group,
 which New York City-based Herzog is confident will occur in the first quarter of the year. "I think it will make Philip Morris 
in the U.S. much more aggressive," she said, referring to the tobacco manufacturer's opportunity to "unleash the beast" 
within itself. "I think it will encourage them to become much more innovative. I think they will cut costs.
 I think they will buy
 back their stock. I think they will look at acquisitions." The company has already shown an interest in acquisitions with its recent
 intent to 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#110207a">
purchase the John Middleton cigar company</a>. Herzog speculated on additional acquisition opportunities, including the
 likelihood that 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#111507a">
Philip Morris could buy the Swedish Match</a> smokeless tobacco company. Herzog also said it will be Philip Morris'

Accentuating the Positive More Effective In Inspiring Smokers to Quit..</a> The study, published in the December 2007 issue of
 Psychology of Addictive Behaviors, examined the use of prospect theory in getting people to quit smoking. Prospect theory
 maintains that gain-framed messages (“You will live longer if you quit smoking”) should be more effective than loss-framed messages
 (“You will die sooner if you do not quit smoking”) when attempting to encourage smokers to quit. The research team randomly
 assigned 258 smokers in a clinical trial in which they received video and printed messages that emphasized either the 
benefits of quitting smoking or the costs of continuing to smoke. All of the participants also received the 
antidepressant bupropion for seven weeks. Among the 170 smokers who completed treatment, those who received the more positive,

    A report issued last Friday (November 30, 2007) by the 
FDA's Science and Advisory Board documented that
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  is understaffed, underfunded and
underperforming is all the evidence Congress should need to reject proposed
legislation that would add responsibility for tobacco regulation to that
overburdened agency. That's the message sent to Congress (12/5/2007) by Jim Martin, President of
<a href="60plus_association.gif">60 Plus
, a national senior advocacy organization</a>. Martin sent a letter
to the House Energy and Commerce Committee urging them not to add to the
FDA's problems by voting in favor of the tobacco regulation legislation.
The legislation Martin asked the committee to reject is known as the
Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (H.R. 1108). It would
force the FDA to take on wide-ranging responsibility for all facets of
tobacco regulation. (<a href="http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/1170947/leader_urges_congress_not_to_worsen_fda_crisis/index.html?source=r_health">

Newport says it’s not stealing Malbroro’s ‘M'</a> - Lorillard Tobacco Co. is denying that its use of the
 letter “M” to promote its Newport cigarettes cashes in on Philip Morris USA’s iconic Marlboro brand. The nation’s No. 1 
tobacco company filed suit in October in U.S. District Court seeking to block Lorillard from using an “M” in its packaging 
for Newport, contending it unfairly infringes on its top-selling brand. Lorillard, which is based in Greensboro, N.C.,
 filed an application in February with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to <font size="4">register “M Newport Blend” and “M Newport Blend 
The Way to Chill” as trademarks.</font> Lorillard said Richmond-based Philip Morris’ “alleged M mark is not famous” and that “consumers
 do not associate the letter M alone with Philip Morris at all, let alone exclusively.” Marlboro, the best selling cigarette
in the world,  is the most popular
 cigarette in the United States,
 with a 41.1 percent share of the retail market. Philip Morris said its brands have a 50.6 share. Lorillard, which is a
 subsidiary of Loews Corp., had a 10 percent share of the U.S. cigarette market. The Newport brand, the best selling 
menthol cigarette in the United States,  had a 9 percent share.

 <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Our children are being threatened – if we don’t take action now we’ll end up with another generation 
of nicotine addicts..</font> With U.S. cigarette sales declining at an average rate of about 2% a year and sales of smokeless 
tobacco products rising at about 6% each year tobacco companies have turned to a product called SNUS. SNUS is a smokeless,
 spitless moist snuff that has been part of the Swedish culture for over 200 years.  Many people consider a product 
like SNUS to be less dangerous than cigarettes because many of the disease-causing toxins associated with smoking
 are created when tobacco is burned.  The Swedes with SNUS being a part of their heritage always have had a low 
prevalence of smoking. As a result rates of lung cancer in men has been the lowest of any country in Europe. Smokeless tobacco 
has been considered a dirty habit because in a social setting it can be difficult to hide since the user has to spit 
and it can be messy. In the United States at the end of the 19th century anti-spitting laws were in force, indicting 
smokeless tobacco’s loss socially acceptability.  (Smokeless tobacco was rapidly replaced with cigarettes – the same 
could happen again;  “Suckers today, smokers tomorrow.”) The one property that makes SNUS tolerable is that it is
 promoted as being “spitless.” The SNUS packet has to be tucked under the upper lip and kept there for several
 minutes without movement. If movement occurs more saliva will be produced and the urge to spit will increase. 
Drooling can be a problem, especially for the inexperienced user and any juice that is swallowed contains 
lots of toxins including carcinogens. More and more studies are surfacing that indicates SNUS users are at an increased risk 
of developing pancreatic cancer.  In addition, a lesion can form at the location in the mouth where the SNUS is continually
 placed. - INCOMPLETE...

“This was a business decision, designed to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing programs,” said 
Jan Smith, a spokeswoman for Reynolds. Smith said that Reynolds takes many “industry and corporate social-responsibility issues” into consideration when
 making business decisions. She said that Reynolds could resume print ads depending on “changing business needs.” Most recent

 More and more Quebec teens are giving up cigarettes.
But many of them are switching to cigars and cigarillos. And that has health advocates worried. The Quebec Institute on 
Statistics says the number of teens smoking cigarettes has gone down by 4 per cent in two years: about 15 per cent 
lighting up. But cigars are bucking that trend, with sales of cigarillos in candy flavours like raspberry, peach and 
 mint chocolate up 300% in Quebec. And kids are eating them up: 22 per cent  up from 18 per cent since 2004. Anti-smoking
groups like the Quebec Council on Tobacco and Health fear their popularity could fuel a 
kid-friendly smoking revival. "It's almost like candies. A teenager can see that it's something you can try like chewing gum."
Spokesman Mario Bujold. "You can get addicted to cigarillos as well as to cigarettes." They can be also be bought as singles 
at any depanneur (convenience store),  something Bujold says needs to be strictly enforced or changed: 
to be sold like cigarettes, in packs, behind the counter, complete with big, frightening warnings of health risks. (Shuyee Lee, CJAD,

Uphill Battle in Teaching Smokers to Use SNUS..</a></font> UST has long pursued a strategy focused on getting smokers to put
 down their cigarettes and make a permanent switch to smokeless or use these products in places such as the office,
 a hotel room, or a restaurant where smoking is forbidden. But UST’s experience shows that Altria Group's Philip Morris and 
Reynolds will have an uphill battle in teaching smokers to use snus. UST has had a Swedish-style product known as 
<a href="Revel_UST_2.jpg">
Revel </a> (2001)

another Swedish-style, pouch product. Its launch was partly born out of frustration over the difficulties associated with
 creating brand awareness for a product given the restrictions on marketing tobacco products. Even with the more recognizable
 brand, its been difficult. “This is a long, slow build,” said Dan Butler, president of UST’s U.S. Smokeless Tobacco unit. 
“You are changing consumer behavior.” Butler said he welcomes the competition from

<font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Maryland - NO New Taxes on Low-Price Cigars YET..</font>
 - State lawmakers increased taxes 
on cigarettes during the special session, but the pipe tobacco flavored cigars such as Black & Mild slipped
though their fingers. (These usually inexpensive cigars are also called "loosies" because they 
can be sold individually or in packs.) The legislation  would have required retailers to sell the cigars in packs of five or more - 
<u>not individual cigars</u>.
Like cigarettes, they would have been taxed $1 per pack of five to 10 cigars and $2 per pack of 11 to 20.
But opponents said the legislation unfairly singled out the Black & Mild (B&M;) brand. We believe it's unfair to target a single
 tobacco product brand, to tax it differently than its competitors," said David Sutton, 
a spokesman for Philip Morris, which owns the B&M; brand.

Philip Morris recently acquired John Middleton, Inc.

Prince Albert's Soft Cherry Vanilla. Each of these brands is available in a five-pack and
 the 25 upright package.) B&M; and other similar products like Swisher Sweets have wide appeal amongst black youth. The 
Maryland House felt the issue of pipe tobacco flavored cigars would be better dealt with separately, along with the tax on moist snuff.

PM USA Invests in R & D..</a> Philip Morris USA discusses its new 450,000 square foot Center for Research and Technology. Sensory scientists
 will work with 
harm-reduction technicians, and marketing types will interact with engineers to quickly develop potential products that
consumers will accept.   David Sylvia, director of media affairs for PM USA said the tobacco manufacturer is
 currently field testing two new flavors of cigarettes, one called Marlboro Smooth and the other called Marlboro Virginia Blend.
 The latter comes from the “bright” flavor profile of Virginia tobacco. Sylvia said the new flavor lines fall into the 
company’s core-business category. A “spit-less” pilot of the new Marlboro Snus, a branded product using its tried-and-true moniker,
 is ongoing in the Dallas-Ft.Worth market, while along the same lines, its Taboka introduction continues testing in Indianapolis.
It was also mentioned that another test, this one in Atlanta, that started last month involving a Marlboro-branded, moist-snuff
 tobacco (MST) product in original and wintergreen flavors. While Snus (pronounced “snoose”) and Taboka fall into a 
“new product, same consumer” category, he said the MST offer branches off into a “new product, new consumer” scenario.
Though Sylvia would not elaborate on any current findings with regards to the ongoing tests, he did say that consumer
 awareness was a major barrier. “With a new product, people just don’t understand,” he said. “Getting them aware is 
a big challenge. Awareness and understanding is critical. ”Any testing in place to date will potentially accelerate as the 
new research center hits capacity."

<a href="http://www.swedishsnus.com/EU/newsevents.asp?ID=49">
Round Snus Can Turns 40..</a> Up until 1967, snus had been packed for decades in oval cans and the 
move to round cans was thought to be so radical that Svenska Tobaks (tobacco operations began in Svenska Tobaks AB, 
the former Swedish tobacco monopoly, which was founded in 1915) felt obliged to run advertisements with headlines
 saying, ‘Stay calm guys! We’ve made new snus cans’. When the cans were developed in
 the middle of the 1960s, the round cans were considered more practical since the snus tended to collect in the corners of 
the square cans making it difficult to collect the tobacco. Also for  manufacturing reasons, the round cans were preferable 
since production became more efficient.  
<a href="snus_general_info.html">Swedes first started tucking snuff snus, known in Sweden as Swedish snus, 
under the lip at the end of the 1700s.</a> Portion packaged SNUS (tea-bag like, packets) was launched in 1973.  
<a href="http://www.northerner.com/html/snusculture2.html">
The dominant 
tradition of snus use in Sweden appears to have prevented the widespread adoption of tobacco combustion (e.g., cigarette smoking).
 This had a profound and lasting effect on Swedish tobacco
 use patterns and — in the case of cigarette smoking — related adverse health consequences.</a>

CHANTIX™ (also Champix) (varenicline) is non-nicotine prescription medicine specifically developed to help adults 
quit smoking. CHANTIX contains no nicotine, but it targets the same receptors that nicotine does. CHANTIX is believed 
to block nicotine from these receptors. Studies show: At the end of 12 weeks of CHANTIX, 44% were able to quit smoking. 
It also helped reduce the urge to smoke. (From WhyQuit.com:

"approximately one-in-five" users quit smoking for a year.</a>)

Posted 11/20/2007 - FDA informed healthcare professionals of reports of suicidal 
thoughts and aggressive and erratic
 behavior in patient who have taken Chantix.</a> There are also 
reports of patients experiencing drowsiness that affected their ability to drive or operate machinery. FDA is currently
 reviewing these cases, along with other recent reports. A preliminary assessment reveals that many of the cases reflect
 new-onset of depressed mood, suicidal ideation, and changes in emotion and behavior within days to weeks of initiating 
Chantix treatment. The role of Chantix in these cases is not clear because smoking cessation, with or without treatment, 
is associated with nicotine withdrawal symptoms and has also been associated with the exacerbation of underlying psychiatric 
illness. However, not all patients described in the cases had preexisting psychiatric illness and not all had discontinued smoking.
The FDA recommends that healthcare professionals monitor patients taking Chantix for behavior and mood changes. Patients taking this 
product should report behavior or mood changes to their doctor and use caution when driving or operating machinery until 
they know how quitting smoking with Chantix may affect them.

found that 34% (see image for news brief)of high school students report that it is "very easy" to obtain smokeless tobacco products. This finding
is of concern because numerous studies have found that higher perceived ease of access to other tobacco products correlates
to a greater risk of use of these products. While cigarettes are typically stored behind the counter at retail, cigars

The progressive reduction of the nicotine content 
of cigarettes has been suggested as a way to wean smokers from nicotine and tobacco. (Clin Pharmacol Ther 80(6):703-714, 2006)
 In this study, 20 healthy adult smokers 
were asked to
 smoke their usual brand for a week. They were then put on a six week regimen of smoking cigarettes with progressively 
lower levels of nicotine. At the end of the six weeks, they were free to return to their usual brand and most did. But tested a month later, 
they were smoking forty per cent fewer cigarettes per day than they did before the study. Furthermore, a quarter of the smokers
 quit their habit entirely while the study was in progress. 
<a href="nbenowitz.gif">
Professor Neal Benowitz</a>, who led the research team from the University of California at San Francisco, said: "This study 
supports the idea that if tobacco companies were required to reduce the levels of nicotine in cigarette tobacco, young
 people who start smoking could avoid becoming addicted, and current smokers could reduce or end their smoking." The new findings
provide support for plans now under discussion in U.S Congress to allow tobacco products to be regulated in the US in the same way as
 medicines. (USA: New Study Suggests That Low-Nicotine Cigarettes Could Help Smokers Quit, Medical News Today, 11/15/2007)

<font size="4">Completely Dissolvable Smokeless Tobacco Products..</font></a> Star Scientific is quick to point out their tobacco products 
are different from moist snuff products like SNUS in that there's never a residue and never the urge to spit. The two products 
 are Ariva(R - introduced in 2003) and Stonewall Hard Snuff(R - introduced in 2001). Stonewall is a larger version of Ariva,
 so it may appeal to heavier smokers. During the 3rd quarter of 2007 Star pursued a variety of initiatives aimed at continued 
expansion of the distribution of Ariva® and Stonewall. Those efforts included a test market in the
 Kroger grocery store chain and expansion of Ariva® distribution through the Walgreen's chain. The company also expects
 to begin distribution of an Ariva® Java blend during the fourth quarter. The results of third-quarter marketing efforts
 appear to confirm the company's view that Ariva® is the first smokeless tobacco product that is an acceptable alternative
 to cigarettes for female smokers, who make up approximately 50% of the U.S. smoking population. Stonewall dissolvable smokeless
 tobacco, which was developed for adults who use traditional moist snuff, is now available in three blends: Wintergreen, Natural 
and Java.  Star ceased manufacturing and distributing discount cigarettes (four discount cigarette brands, Gunsmoke (TM),
 Sport (TM), Vegas (TM)  
and Mainstreet (TM) - TW),in June 2007. <a href="Snus_Abstract_July_2006a.html">For more information

Prolonged Use of SNUS (Swedish moist snuff)
 Increases Risk of Fatal Cardiovascular Disease(CVD)  and Stroke..</a></font> Snus has also 
been found to increase the risk of high blood pressure, a known factor CVD. The objective of the doctoral thesis was to study 
the association between snuff use and CVDs. 
Data from two population studies limited to men were analyst. To avoid confounding from smoking the main analyses were limited to 
never smokers. The first of the studies reported that its consumers run a 30% 
(approximately) higher risk of fatal heart attack than people who have never used the product. This greater risk is even higher
 for those who take more than 50 grams 
of snus a day. Amongst those who suffer non-fatal heart attacks, users of snus have a higher fatality rate in general than 
non-users, and from cardiovascular diseases in particular. The studies reveal no greater risk of stroke amongst users of snus;
 however, users were more likely to suffer a fatal stroke. (

 The Wisconsin state legislature approved a two-year, $57.2 billion budget, which Governor
 Jim Doyle signed on Friday, October 19, 2007. The budget includes a $1-per-pack cigarette tax increase and an increase in the tax 
on other tobacco products (OTP) from 25% to 50% of the wholesale price, said the National Association of Tobacco Outlets (NATO) in an E-News Bulletin. 
There is a cap of 50 cents per large cigar, and moist snuff will be taxed at a rate of $1.31 per ounce. The current cigarette tax in Wisconsin is 77 
cents per pack. Wisconsin had been one of only seven states that had not increased its cigarette tax in recent years, 
according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. The governor had proposed a $1.25-per-pack cigarette tax increase and a 65.6% OTP tax rate.
Smokeless tobacco products classified as "moist snuff" actually received an exemption from being taxed in the budget that
 was passed by the legislature but Gov. Doyle used his veto pen to remove this exemption from the budget he signed. The new tax
 rates will take effect on Jan. 1, 2008. A floor stocks tax will be assessed on cigarettes and moist snuff only,
 NATO said. Moist snuff will be taxed on a weight-based standard and not on an ad valorem basis - this is a win 
for United States Smokeless Tobacco, Inc. According to Doyle, the cigarette tax increase will reduce smoking rates, and it dedicates new funds to pay the cost
 of tobacco-related illness and invests $30 million in smoking prevention and cessation programs.

<a href="http://www.swedsnus.com/site/988688/page/909833">(General Snus – An Authentic Swedish Snus by
Swedish Match.)</a>  General Sterk comes in a white-portion format - this is a
production technique that results in a gently dryer pouch product with a longer-lasting taste. Sterk contains more nicotine 
than most common snus types in the Norwegian market. General is the snus brand of choice for Norwegians, with a market share of 
approximately 70%. It has a distinctive taste; a powerful tobacco flavor with hints of pepper and citrus zest. General Sterk contains
24 pouches each weighing one gram.
(<a href="http://www.swedishmatch.com/Eng/GeneralSterkPowerfulNewcomerToGeneralFamilyInNorway.asp">More from Swedish Match</a>).
 According to Dr. Karl E. Lund, research director at the Norwegian Institute for Alcohol
 and Drug Research in Norway over the past decade, daily use of snus has tripled among teens and 
young adults. Swedish Match, makes what Dr. Lund calls "starter kits." "This is snus sold in glamorous metal boxes…where the snus 
is seasoned with different kinds of fruit flavors," he explains. "[They are] easy to use for snus novices."
(NCI Cancer Bulletin, Feb 20, 2007 vol 4 number 8) After the Norwegian government in June 2004 implemented a strict
 indoor smoking ban in public places, sales 
of snus skyrocketed, and several new variants of the product (
<a href="http://www.rateitall.com/i-950846-nick-johnny-snus.aspx">

it is such a part of Swedish culture that they were able to write a provision that allowed Sweden to still sell Snus but still

public health professionals want inveterate (hard-nose, long established, deep-rooted) cigarette smokers to switch to Snus.

Dr. Brad Rodu</a>, a strong proponent of the use of Snus by 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#091807a">
inveterate tobacco smokers</a>, tells us Swedes have adopted the
 public health practice of "harm reduction," in 
this case substituting relatively safe smokeless tobacco for cigarettes. Dr. Lars E. Rutqvist, the Vice President for Scientific Affairs 
 at Swedish Match (the world's second largest maker of snuff and chewing tobacco and market leader in Sweden -
volume share of 90% at the end of 2006) tells us the drive in snus sales in Sweden has
 been in response to the smoking ban rather than the perceived advantage to user’s health. Comments of a Swedish American in Sweden:
Another argument for the use of SNUS is 
that it keeps people from smoking, but I don't buy that argument. I know all kinds of Swedes who smoke whenever they get a chance
but because of the ban on smoking indoors use snus when they are in the bar or at work or anywhere else they can't get their 
nicotine fix right away. The second they step outside though they light up.(10/5/2007) Another argument for the use of SNUS is 
that it keeps people from smoking, but I don't buy that argument.

Margaretha Haglund,</a> the Director of Tobacco Prevention for the Swedish

Dr. Rodu has a web site entitled 
<a href="http://tobaccoharmreduction.org/">
TobaccoHarmReduction.org</a> that attempts to convince people that smokeless is the way to go
 using either moist snuff and even chewing tobacco. One of the two major headings on the first page of the site is entitled
"Reduce the harm from Nicotine use: Go smokeless." A number of studies have shown that nicotine levels resulting from the
use of smokeless tobacco are either the same or even higher than with tobacco smoking. (Maximum levels of nicotine were similar
 but, because of prolonged absorption, overall nicotine exposure was 
twice as large after single exposures to smokeless tobacco compared with cigarette smoking (Benowitz et al.,
 Clin Pharmacol Ther. Jul;44(1):23-8, 1988))  Leading tobacco researchers have 
stated that there is no evidence smokeless tobacco can help people quit smoking - see <u>

November 9, 2007 - <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Adult Tobacco Smoking Rate in the United States has

remains the leading preventable cause of disease
 and death in the United States, resulting in approximately 438,000 deaths annually .  Center for Disease 
Control (CDC)
 analyzed data from the 2006 National Health 
Interview Survey (NHIS). The report summarized the results of that analysis, which indicated that in 2006, approximately 
20.8% (45.3 million) of U.S. adults were current cigarette smokers (80.1% (36.3 million)
 smoked every day, and 19.9% (9.0 million) smoked some days). <a href="Prevalence_Smoking_1965_2006_CDC.gif">
This prevalence had not changed significantly since 2004, suggesting a 
stall in the previous 7-year (1997--2004) decline in cigarette smoking among adults in the United States.</a> One reason for 
this leveling off 
may be a 
result of funding for state control and prevention programs decreased about 20% from 2002 to 2006 while tobacco industry
 marketing spending nearly doubled from about $7 billion to $13 billion between 1998 and 2005. One of the U.S. national health

Szymanczyk</a> added, “The plan is to accelerate the Black & Mild brand’s market share growth momentum in the years 
ahead by leveraging the expertise and capabilities of both John Middleton Inc. and PM USA.”
Black & Mild, a cigar made with a proprietary blend of pipe tobacco, enjoys strong brand equity, high brand 
awareness and solid volume and share growth momentum, Altria said. The brand is the second-largest selling 
machine-made large cigar in the United States, it added, with a retail market share of approximately 23%,
 and the Black & Mild five-cigar pack is the best-selling large machine-made cigar package in the United States, said Altria, citing data through June 2007 from Information Resources Inc. (IRI). It is particularly strong in the U.S.
South and Southeast, which together account for approximately 55% of segment volume. (CSP Daily News) C-store owners

<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#070207"> 
Kansas
 City</a> Star, 10/31/2007..</font>
As the Shawnee Mission East choir hit its final note, senior Clark Neal felt the nicotine start to work. It had been
 only five minutes since he bent down, opened a tin of 
<a href="Camel_SNUS_ad_News_Observer_Whats_UP_7_13_2007_3_of_3.jpg">
Camel Snus</a> Spice and wedged the tiny 
pouch between his gums and upper lip, but he could already feel the buzz. And the best part was, no one
 could tell he was getting a head rush in the middle of class. 'I really can use Snus whenever and wherever
 I want,' Neal said. 'It's easy, it's super-discreet ... and none of the teachers will ever know what I'm doing.'
Neal knows he isn't the only student who has discovered Camel's newest product: Snus, a non-chew, no-spit oral
tobacco. Four or five of his friends use Snus at school on a daily basis, Neal said, and underclassmen find the new 
product especially appealing. Neal thinks students will continue to use Snus because it's a cheap way to get a fast, 
discreet fix. 'Pretty much the whole school knows about Snus,' Neal said. Snus has been advertised in The Pitch
 and The Kansas City Star. In 'The 
<a href="Camel_SNUS_c_stores_promos.html">
Abridged Guide
 to Snusing,</a>'
 published by RJ Reynolds in The Pitch, Snus is described as the perfect tobacco product if you want
 'pleasure for wherever.''Tobacco companies are doing everything they can to make tobacco use socially
 acceptable,' said Edward Ellerbeck, chairman of preventive medicine at the University of Kansas Medical Center.
 'They're flavoring it to make it more appetizing, redesigning the tins to make it more appealing, making
 everything easier for entry-level use.' Health experts say that's what makes Snus even more dangerous for the 
younger generation. Doing Snus, getting a head rush and not being caught is appealing to kids, Ellerbeck 
said, and it's easy to overlook health risks.  'High school kids using Snus scares the hell out of 
me,' Ellerbeck said. 'Fewer and fewer kids are starting
 to smoke ... but you can see that for tobacco companies to ensure long-term success, they need a whole 
new generation of tobacco users. Snus could be the product that sucks kids in.' 'This product allows you to enjoy tobacco pleasure without bothering others.' Instead of smoking
 a pack of cigarettes a week, Neal, 17, goes through a tin of Snus Spice, or 20 pouches,
a week. He pays an 18-year-old friend $8 to buy a $5 tin for him. Neal considers his switch a healthy choice. 
He hasn't smoked a cigarette in more than a month. Neal, however, considers the benefits of private Snus use more
 important than potential health and legal 
hazards. 'I think it's really worth more in terms of when and how frequently I can use it,' Neal said. 
'It's a new product, so you have to give it time. But I think it will filter through to everyone eventually.'

In May 2005 our companies in South Africa and Sweden began test-marketing the sachet variety of snus 
using two of our major cigarette brands.</a>  We were responding to public health stakeholders who told us they believe snus, 
properly regulated, can contribute to reducing the net public health impact of tobacco use, and to consumers who told us in
dialogue that developing less harmful products is one of the most important things a tobacco business can do. Encouraged by
 feedback from consumers and some health experts, operations in both Sweden and South Africa have expanded and 
limited sales in Norway started. We have also opened our own snus product development
 facility at our R&D; laboratories in the UK and have run a limited consumer
 test in Japan. c</a> Sweden - Snus is already more popular than cigarettes in Sweden but we set out to see if our global
 Lucky Strike brand could  extend its appeal to adult smokers.  Our Nordic company first offered our product in just
 300 outlets in Stockholm but it is now available in major cities across the country. 
South Africa - Snus is now sold under our Peter Stuyvesant and Lucky Strike brands in some 400 outlets in
 Johannesburg and Pretoria.  Snus is not widely known in South Africa but the brands are bringing it to smokers’ attention. At 
first the tins had to be labelled with the health warning for cigarettes.  Research showed that few consumers saw snus
 as less harmful than smoking and many even believed it was more harmful.  In a positive step, the Department for Health 
allowed a change of health warning from “Causes Cancer” to “Tobacco is Addictive”.  A voluntary warning on the side of 
the tin says:  “This tobacco product can be harmful to your health”.

You could probably hide this stuff from teachers and parents pretty 
easily. ("You Snus, You Lose" posted by PAgent at 1:50pm on January 8, 2007).
Dr. Stephen Hecht at the University of Minnesota tells us that the pasteurization process lowers the
carcinogenic 
<a href="nitrosamines.html">
nitrosamines</a> in tobacco but the levels are still 10-100 times higher than the levels in any other consumer
product. 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#081007b">
A recent study by Dr. Stephen Hecht and colleagues</a>suggests that smokeless tobacco is not a good option
for reducing health risks from smoking. Still some public health professionals seem to think SNUS should be used 
as a harm reduction product in inveterate (firmly and long established) smokers that have no interest
in quitting. Tobacco companies are targeting a much younger crowd of young adults and any kids they can entice along 
the way. We must prevent this from happening or we'll end up with a generation of nicotine addicts.

 The minister points out that the provincial government supports 
the Alberta Spit Tobacco Education Program, which is a youth smokeless tobacco prevention program.  Goals of
 the program include raising the profile of smokeless tobacco use as a health issue, increasing awareness about
the harms associated with use, removing the positive association of smokeless tobacco use with sport, and increasing
 the capacity of oral health professionals and the community to address spit tobacco use.He continues - the sale
of snus is outside the regulatory jurisdiction of the provincial government and rests with the federal government.
However, Bill 45, the Smoke-free Places (Tobacco Reduction) Amendment Act  will, if passed, prohibit the display, 
advertising, and promotion of tobacco products in retail outlets, and will prohibit tobacco
 sales in pharmacies, health care facilities, and public post-secondary campuses.

October 26, 2007 - Revised State Children's Health Insurance (S-CHIP) Bill - The House passed a revised children's health proposal (H.R. 3963) 
Thursday (10/25/2007), but not by the two-thirds margin (265-142, 7-votes short).
As with the already-vetoed bill, the revised measure would add would $35 billion over five years, financed by a 61-cent increase in the federal excise tax on a pack of cigarettes. 
This new version of the S-CHIP bill still contains all of the same tax
 increases on cigarettes, cigars, little cigars, pipe tobacco, smokeless tobacco and RYO tobacco products.
Democratic leaders said they made changes to the bill regarding concerns about participation by adults,
 illegal immigrants and families able to afford health insurance. President Bush is willing to compromise
 and expand the SCHIP program by $20 billion over five years (the President originally wanted to limit the spending 
increase to $5 billion). <font color="FFFFFF">But it was made clear that that the President continues to 
oppose an increase
in cigarette and tobacco taxes to fund the expansion of the SCHIP program.</font> If the new bill does not become law, 
Representative Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) is quoted by the CQ News Service as stating that another temporary SCHIP 
extension bill would be passed to continue the program possibly for a year until the fall of 2008. (

Anti-tobacco conference details plethora of new products - new ways to ingest nicotine..</a> - The National Conference

 industry attempts
 to adapt to smoking bans (e.g., trying to convince smokers that you can 
satisfy your nicotine addiction in places where smoking is banned by using SNUS) it is developing dozens of new ways for the body to absorb nicotine -- from 
hookahs to snus to lozenges to smokeless nicotine delivery systems. And, in a clear attempt to attract
 younger users,
 they come in more flavors than you can find at a Ben & Jerry's ice cream store.

the National Cancer Institute has developed an experimental fast-track research process (called "rapid mobilization") so scientists and 
public health officials can keep up with those new products and devise their own public programs to counter

 of €19,828 (US$28,089) per day if it continues to disobey the ban on oral tobacco. The Aland archipelago,situated in

 changed local laws to bow to EU wishes — but  the EU said they did not go far enough 
because they only stopped the snus variety and not 
other types of oral tobacco, such as chewing tobacco, from entering the market. Finnish media reported from 
the Aland Islands that following the EU executive's decision, legislators on Tuesday  (10/23/2007) began to
 compile a law
to ban all forms of tobacco in the archipelago of 25,000 inhabitants. (International Herald Tribune - Europe)

October 18, 2007 - <font color="FFFFFF">Bush's SCHIP veto stands</font>
 - The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly failed (273 in favor and 156 against, the vote was just 13 votes k) yesterday to override President Bush’s veto of H.R. 976, the bill passed by
Congress to reauthorize and expand the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP). The legislation would have 
authorized an increase in federal tobacco taxes—including a 61-cents-per-pack cigarette tax hike to $1 per
 pack from the current 39 cents, as well as other tobacco tax increases—to pay for the expansion.
The House vote was just 13 votes short 
of the two-thirds majority needed to override the veto - to view

Even before the vote, Congress passed and the president signed legislation to continue government operations,
that included a short extension of the SCHIP bill at its current funding levels with no tax increases until mid-November.
Congress will likely consider a revised version 
of the SCHIP bill soon in order to keep the program running after the temporary extension expires. (CSP (Convenience Store/Petroleum)

Retail market share for Marlboro cigarettes rose 0.5 points to a record 41.1%</a>, compared 
with that of the third quarter of last year.) In July 2006 Philip Morris USA introduced Taboka,
 a smoke-free, spit-free tobacco pouch product, into test 
market in the Indianapolis area. According to PM they learned a lot from the Taboka test market and are applying those learnings
 to the Marlboro Snus test market. <font size="4">In a survey of retailers in the Indianapolis Area by analyst Christopher Growe 
of A.G. Edwards & Sons, it was found that the test for Taboka was going poorly and that retailers said sales were "soft with 
little need to restock inventory." A USA Today visit to a dozen convenience, tobacco and Wal-Mart stores in 
Indianapolis found Taboka widely available, often in dispensers displayed near Marlboro cigarettes and priced at $1.20 to $3.80
per pack. Retailers say consumers have shown little interest. Pat Bowman at The Tobacco Shop says, "I haven't sold any at all."
He says even people who had coupons for free samples didn't want Taboka once they knew what it was. 
It looks like widespread use of SNUS will fail because it's culture-bound and highly resistant to migration.

Q2 2007 Earnings Call 
(July 26, 2007 9:00 am ET)</a> - Comments pertaining to SNUS - Dan Butler (Daniel W. Butler has been the President of
 U S Smokeless Tobacco Company, 
a subsidiary of UST Inc., since November 3, 2005), 
 Snus in our view really means discrete spit-free pouches and we've been testing 
that concept with Rebel and Skoal Dry and 
other things for a number of years. So we clearly have the technology and we've been gathering a lot of learning about this 
for some time. I think we and our competitors might think are all probably trying to optimize the product bundle and get that 
right and get the positioning right. We continue to learn from our test markets both in Denver with Rebel and our other two 
markets with Skoal Dry and we will make adjustments. We do think that there is a strong concept here. 
<font size="4" color="FFFFFF">
I think it's going to 
take some time, some education, awareness building and I expect it to be a slow build. At this point I would say none of 
those products are in the marketplace are off to a rapid vapid start. I believe it is going to be a long slow build but 
we are committed to the concept we think there's something there.</font> The other thing I would say about snus is I don't view that
 at all as something that has a major impact on our core business. It is not traditional round can moist smokeless tobacco
 in all of the test markets. Ours and competitors, we have seen no impact on our core business and in fact have seen category
 growth accelerate, those are products that are really designed for and positioned to adult smokers that appears to be the 
source of volume. And I think with us and others making investments in building the awareness and the trial for
these things will be good for the overall category. Murray Kessler, President and CEO of UST, the holding company for U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company)- Yes and I would just
 add to 
that, there's nothing we have seen from those competitive test markets that would dictate a change in our strategy.
We will make the decisions that are right for our shareholders based on our ability to create value and launch winning products, 
that's always our model.

 October 17, 2007 - Country to Eliminate Smoking - The
<a href="http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/oceania/nu.htm">
 South Pacific nation of Niue</a>, population about 1,500, could become
 the first country in the world to eliminate smoking by paying its 200 smokers to quit the habit, its premier said Monday (10/15/07).
Premier Vivian Young said it would be cheaper to pay all smokers up to NZ$2,000 (US$1,543; euro1,085) each to stop 
smoking than to continue paying their health care costs. "Of course I am serious. If your health bill is climbing beyond NZ$200,000 (US$154,000; euro108,000), up to NZ$1 million 
(US$771,000; euro542,000), per year then it is preferable to pay (smokers to quit)," he told reporters at the South Pacific 
Forum meeting in Tonga. (Niue is a free association with New Zealand - diplomatic relations are conducted by New Zealand.)

October 16, 2007 - <font size="4">Statin Use Improves Survival in COPD Patients..</font>  COPD is an umbrella term for
 a range of progressive chronic lung diseases, such as emphysema and bronchitis, which block the airways and restrict oxygen
 flow around the body. COPD is mainly caused by tobacco smoking (90%), it's the 4th leading cause of death in the U.S.A. and is a
 progressive and irreversible with no cure. Previous reports 
have shown an elevated risk of ischemic heart disease in COPD patients and since statins are known to reduce ischemic heart
disease morbidity and mortality, these agents may be of particular benefit for COPD patients. Statins Reduce COPD Mortality
Statin therapy improves survival following an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The finding 
emerged from a retrospective study of 854 patients (mean age, 70.8 years) who had a COPD exacerbation and who were followed 
for a mean of 1.9 years. A total of 333 patients died during follow-up. The crude mortality rate per 1000 patient-years was 
110 in statin users and 191 in those not using a statin. The use of a statin reduced risk of death by 43%. Treatment with inhaled
corticosteroids further increased the survival benefit associated with statin use (Soyseth V,
 et al. Statin use is associated with reduced mortality in COPD. Eur Respir J. 2007; 29:279-284). Statins
(atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin (Lescol), lovastatin (Mevacor), avastatin (Pravachol), mvastatin (Zocor),
 rosuvastatin (Crestor)) have proven to be
 very effective in reducing cholesterol and in reducing the risk of heart attack and death. For this reason, and because 
they are generally well tolerated, they have become some of the most commonly prescribed drugs in the United States.

October 15, 2007 - <a href="http://www.uga.edu/news/artman/publish/071004_TobaccoAds.shtml"> Youth exposed to smokeless tobacco 
ads despite settlement… </a> A 1998 settlement designed to limit the marketing of
smokeless tobacco to youth hasn’t been effective,
 according to a new University of Georgia (GA) study by Dean Krugman, professor in the Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication 
published in the early online edition of the American Journal of Public Health.  When the major cigarette producers signed the 
Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) a similar agreement known as the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (STMSA)
 was signed by the attorneys general and U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company, the largest smokeless tobacco manufacturer. 
To gauge 
advertising exposure and whether smokeless tobacco companies have complied with the STMSA, Krugman and his colleagues analyzed 
data on readership and advertising in popular magazines over a 10-year period. At both the beginning and the end of the study
 period, roughly two-thirds of youth were exposed to smokeless tobacco advertising in magazines (66 and 64 percent, respectively).
 The study found that smokeless tobacco advertising in magazines actually increased in the first year after the STMSA went into
 effect, reaching 83 percent of adolescents. Exposure dropped sharply to 57 percent in 2000, but rates steadily 
increased in later 
years. <font style="Background-color:yellow">Krugman is  especially concerned about the test marketing of Marlboro and Camel branded smokeless products,
 which 
he said will have an instant appeal to youth. “They’re testing products with brand names that have been overwhelmingly successful 
with young people,” Krugman said. “The power of those brands will create a built-in appeal for their smokeless products.”</font> 
(GA study: Youth exposed to smokeless tobacco ads despite settlement by: Sam Fahmy) In the U.S.A, Marlboro is by far the most 
popular cigarette among youth smokers, with nearly half the youth market, and Camel is one of the three most popular 
cigarette brands among youth. <font style="Background-color:yellow">These brands are sure to tempt children to try these new smokeless products.</font>

Ban on shop tobacco displays

Belinda Hughes, Tobacco Control Advisor for the Cancer Society of New Zealand, stated, “Make no mistake, cigarette displays are
 determined, planned and strategic marketing tools. And our latest research proves this!” The research shows that nearly half
of New Zealand smokers agree that cigarette displays at the checkout make it harder for smokers to quit saying the displays
 trigger impulse buying. Ms Hughes is also concerned about the impact the retail displays have on children. “The prominent 
displays of tobacco products as ‘normal’ consumer items can distort
 young peoples’ perceptions of the prevalence (and therein social acceptability) of smoking. We need to do everything in
 our power to support smokers
to successfully break the addiction. Getting cigarettes out of sight is a good first step.” (

British American Tobacco's Lucky
Strike snus has been promoted in South Africa with "Can't smoke? Snus!" in a naked attempt to keep nicotine

California bans smoking in cars with kids</a> - California
 has added another place where the state's 4 million smokers may not light up – in cars when any child under 18 is inside.
Starting January 1, 2008 motorists will face a $100 fine if caught smoking with a child in a vehicle, on the road or parked, under a bill signed by
 Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger yesterday.
The car-smoking measure, Senate Bill 7 by Sen. Jenny Oropeza, D-Carson, was hailed as a safeguard against exposure to toxic secondhand
 smoke. Similar legislation had been repeatedly blocked by lawmakers in recent years. (
<a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/2006-releases/press10052006.html">
A Harvard School of Public Health report 
indicated that secondhand smoke in cars can be up to 10 times more of a health risk than secondhand smoke in a home.</a>)
<font color="FFFFFF" size="4">Major 
limitation of this legislation: Violations would be a secondary offense, which means motorists could not be stopped
 solely for smoking with a child on board.</font> Most likely this is the reason - there was no official opposition from the 
tobacco industry. California becomes the 
3rd state along with Arkansas and Louisiana to protect children in vehicles from secondhand smoke. Arkansas now bans smoking
 in cars with children age 6 and younger, 
while Louisiana has limited the ban when children 13 and younger are in  the vehicle. A number of municipalities such as 
New York City are considering a similar ban - see related news briefs.

October 6, 2007 -  Professor John Britton, chair of the Royal College of Physicians (RCP)tobacco advisory group, 
believes smokers should be able to buy a lower risk alternative to cigarettes. 
British American Tobacco is quick to agree with Professor Britton and the RCP that smokers should be able use a tobacco 
product like SNUS which the Royal College has said is significantly less harmful
than smoking.(Doctors call for new nicotine products, London (Reuters), news.scotsmen.com, 10/5/2007) <font color="FFFFFF">But WHOSE listening

Smoking Practitioners (BASSP) in Manchester on September 26, 2007 with an audience of over 100 smoking cessation
 specialists from hospitals, primary care and management within the National Health Service from all over the UK, voted strongly
 against the proposal to make SNUS more available in their practice - see related news brief:
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#100207">October 2, 2007</a>. Dr. Britton implies that it is not nicotine that kills but it's
 the hundreds of other toxic chemicals that come with it. <font color="FFFFFF">IS THIS TRUE!!</font> Nicotine alone
 is an extremely toxic; 60 mg of nicotine (about the amount in three or four cigarettes will kill an adult). Not enough is known
 about smokeless tobacco.
 As pointed out by  Marita Broadstock in her
 systematic review (Systematic Review of the health effects of
modified smokless tobacco products, NZHTA Report, February 2007, Volume 10 Number 1), the number of studies on smokeless tobacco is 
relatively slight compared to the wealth of literature published relating to smoking.) More and more studies are surfacing 
about the dangers of nicotine, e.g., a new study from Weill Cornell Medical College  
provides evidence that
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#091307d">
nicotine may accelerate atherosclerosis and may be as dangerous as tar</a>. 
 A recent by Dr. Stephen Hecht and colleagues
suggests that <a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#081007b">smokeless tobacco is not a good option for reducing health risks
  from smoking</a>
Considerable more quality research and product regulation is necessary prior to considering smokeless tobacco as a harm reduction
 method (Drs. Dorothy Hatsukami, Charlotte Lemmonds and Scott Tomar, Prev Med 38(3):309-317, 2004).

FDA Head: 'No' to Tobacco
Cigarettes too "inherently dangerous" to regulate; would "undermine mission."</a>  The head of the federal Food & Drug
Administration (FDA) 
<a href="voneschenbachandrew.jpg">
Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach</a>, the FDA commissioner said that his agency should not be required to regulate tobacco, but
 that it is open to some expanded role in the fight against smoking. 
Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach, the FDA commissioner, did not attend the hearing Wednesday on legislation to authorize his agency 
to determine how tobacco products should be made, marketed and sold, said the report. In a statement sent to the House 
Energy & Commerce Committee’s Subcommittee on Health, von Eschenbach said: "Associating the agency with the approval of these
 inherently dangerous products would undermine the agency’s mission.” He added that the legislation would not give the FDA—which 
is responsible for such things
 as pharmaceutical safety—adequate money to establish a new regulatory structure for tobacco and that the bill 
sets unrealistic deadlines to make progress against smoking. (CSP News) <u>Without regulations that strictly limit the 
distribution of SNUS we will end up with another generation of nicotine addicts.  from SNUS.biz: Even Chris Proctor, 
Head of Science
and Regulation for British American Tobacco has stated, “We’re also responding to public health stakeholders who told us 
they believe snus, PROPERLY REGULATED, can contribute to reducing the impact of tobacco on public health. We hope more stakeholders,
 including governments, will agree.” Hyland et al. (Addictive Behaviors 31:1190-1200, 2006) have concluded that only
 under strict regulations the increase in low-nitrosamine smokeless tobacco use could reduce overall smoking prevalence
 yielding potentially substantial health benefits. Well - at the present time it looks like we are NOT going
 to have a federal agency to regulate tobacco products in the USA. .</u> <font color="FFFFFF">At least in the U.S.A. we'd never have

 a hole in the head</a> - the world does not need: smokeless, chewless and spitless tobacco. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd.,is 
now test marketing in about 230 retail outlets in Edmonton, SNUS 
under the brand name du Maurier. Look for it in the fridge, near the Red Bull. Canada has 4.5 million smokers, and about 80
per cent of them are addicted to nicotine. The widespread availability of snus would create more nicotine addicts,
 and provide a marginal benefit to smokers. Despite the whitewashing and the soft-peddling by Imperial Tobacco, the reality
is that snus is not designed to replace cigarette sales, but as an add-on. Smokers will likely stuff these little 
nicotine-laced bags in their mouths when they are craving a smoke and it's too cold 
to go outside, or when they are in public places where there are smoking restrictions.
If smokers are looking to quit, there are many proven methods. This isn't one of them. Snus is not a smoking cessation aide, 
it's a smoking prolongation aide. It's also a fairly blatant method of recruiting young people to tobacco. Sell them 
this seemingly innocuous product that tastes good and provides a nicotine buzz, and in no time they will be lighting up.

October 4, 2007 - British American Tobacco (BAT) feels its their corporate social responsibility to continue to press European
 regulators to lift the ban on snus, the smokeless tobacco, arguing that the use of snus helps to reduce tobacco-related harm. 
(It is important to note that sucking tobacco like SNUS is prohibited for import and sale in all 
the European Union countries and permitted only in Sweden and non-EU Scandinavian countries - Norway.)Tobacco companies 
have warned public health professionals if they don’t support the smokeless tobacco alternative
 they’ll be at fault for the suffering from chronic sickness and death of tobacco smokers. The European Commission is reviewing the
 EU’s tobacco legislation, but it made clear that a relaxation of the ban was unlikely. 
 “We will be guided by the advice of our scientific committee. It has already produced its report ... and this clearly 
sets out the harm snus does to health,” a spokesman said. At the 1st National Conference for the British Association for Stop 
Smoking Practitioners (BASSP) in Manchester on September 26, 2007 with an audience of over 100 smoking cessation
 specialists from hospitals, primary care and management within the National Health Service from all over the UK, voted strongly
 against the proposal to make SNUS more available in their practice - see related news brief:
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#100207">October 2, 2007</a>. SNUS is outlawed by the European Union (except Sweden) 
mainly because it was deemed an attraction to children, who would become easily hooked and move on to cigarettes. 
Imperial Tobacco Canada 
 (a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of British American Tobacco(BAT)) announced that it will test market a reduced harm product, as
compared to cigarettes, with the introduction of Swedish-style snus in Edmonton retail outlets - see related
news brief:<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#091207">September 12, 2007</a>.
BAT accounts for about 10 per cent of sales in the Swedish snus market. BAT is the largest stockholder in Reynolds American with
approximately 42% of shares. <a href="Came_SNUS_ad_N_O_WhatsUP_8_10_2007_2of2.jpg">
Camel SNUS</a> now being test marketed in at least eight cities in the U.S. is manufactured in conjunction 
with
BAT in Sweden. <u>From snuz.biz:</u> In about May 2005 BAT introduced two new snus products – one an extension of its Lucky Strike 
cigarettes and the other of its Peter Stuyvesant cigarettes--in Johannesburg, South Africa and Stockholm, Sweden.

October 3, 2007 -  President Bush vetoed a bipartisan bill expanding a popular
 children's health insurance program Wednesday, setting up an override battle with Congress. The White House sought little 
attention for Mr. Bush's action, with the president casting his veto behind closed 
doors without any fanfare or news coverage. The program is a joint state-federal effort that subsidizes health coverage 
for 6.6 million people, mostly children, from families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford
 their own private coverage. The Democrats who control Congress, with significant support from Republicans, passed the legislation
 to add $35 billion over five years to allow an additional 4 million children into the program. It would be funded by raising 
the federal cigarette tax by 61 cents to $1 per pack. Democratic congressional leaders said they may put off the override attempt
 for as long as two weeks to maximize pressure on Republican House members whose votes will be critical.(

Tobacco Tax Still Seaworthy - Federal increase could still set sail even if Bush’s S-CHIP veto torpedoes legislation</a>,
 CSP Daily News, September 27, 2007) The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids estimates the following benefits from a 61-cent federal 
cigarette tax increase: Pack sales decline in the US: -1.855 billion, Percent decrease in youth smoking : 9.2%,
Increase in total number of kids alive today who will not become smokers: 1,873,000, Number of current adult smokers in the US 
who would quit: 1,171,000. The group also points to millions of dollars in health savings from fewer smoking-affected pregnancies 
and births. Add to that hundreds of millions in savings from fewer smoking caused heart attacks and strokes. 
The Campaign sees nearly $44 billion dollars in long-term health care savings from overall smoking declines. Of course there 
is no way to estimate the decreased emotional toll on loved ones of people 
who would quit smoking and avoid the agony of lung cancer and other smoking- related illnesses.

October 2, 2007 - <i>Be the 1st to know..</i> The first National Conference for the British Association for Stop Smoking Practitioners (BASSP) 
in Manchester on September 26, 2007, the topic: 
whether  <font size="4"> 'harm reduction techniques affect a smokers health.'</font>  The presentations concentrated around
 the potential for
 Swedish moist tobacco (SNUS) in harm reduction. Speaking for a greater use and its potential role in harm reduction was
<font color="FFFFFF">Professor John Britton</font> who heads the Royal College of Physicians Tobacco Committee in the UK. He argued that it has potential
 in a carefully legislated and controlled way and should not be discounted. <font size="4">Speaking against the use 
of SNUS, <font color="FFFFFF">Dr Keir Lewis</font>,
 Senior Lecturer in Swansea School of Medicine and a Respiratory Physician from South Wales (UK) argued that the science to date 
is flawed, with no prospective, randomised controlled trials that show it's usefulness in smoking reduction and you cannot
 extrapolate retrospective, cross-sectional and often old data from one country into another. He contrasted this lack of good 
scientific evidence for SNUS in helping smokers quit cigarettes with the clearly known dangers of SNUS and highlighted some 
of the current advertising and subversive strategies used by it's manufacturers. The audience of over 100 smoking cessation
 specialists from hospitals, primary care and management within the National Health Service from all over the UK, voted strongly
 against the proposal  to make SNUS more available in their practice.</font>
The British Thoracic Society supported the meeting and the keynote speaker (and patron of the newly formed BASSP) was the 
Member of Parliament Mr Kevin Barron, who is Chairman of the House of Commons Health Select Committee and the man mainly
 responsible for driving through most of the recent legislation against smoking in enclosed spaces in England.

 A Marlboro product promotion( like "Buy One, Get one Free") will also be coming out soon. 
It will be buy a pack of Marlboro,

Lorillard Hiking Prices, Too

 that Lorillard is following other cigarette manufactures by increasing the prices on its flagship Newport brand.
Newport’s wholesale list price will increase by five cents per pack effective September 25, she said, adding,
 “This pricing action is in line with its main competitors, <a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#090707">[Philip Morris USA]</a>

It brings in about 91% of Lorillard's sales by volume. Other brands include Kent, Max, Maverick, Old Gold, Satin and True.

Bush Reaffirms S-CHIP Veto</a> - President Bush said at a press conference yesterday (9/20/2007)that
he will veto the State Children's Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP) bill that Democrats in Congress hope to pass that
 includes tobacco tax increases because he sees the bill as “an incremental step toward the goal 
of government-run health care.” He said that he supports reauthorizing the program, and that his 2008 budget proposed to increase
 S-CHIP funding  by $5 billion over five years, a 20% increase over current funding levels. <u>Democrats reportedly want to 
pay for the program by raising the tax on cigarettes by 61 cents per pack, to $1 per pack from the current 39 cents per pack.</u>
Answering a reporter’s question,  “If there is a tax increase on cigarettes to fund the S-CHIP program, is that a tax
increase you oppose?”, the President said, “We don't need to raise taxes.” He added, “The legislation would raise taxes
 on working people.” Democrats said they have a veto-proof majority in the Senate and that it will pass in the House with some support
 from moderate Republicans, but concede they may not have a veto-proof margin, reported CNN. (CSP Daily News) See related

 entitled, "Tobacco Harm Reduction: An Alternate Cessation Strategy for Inveterate Smokers," or Dr. Carol Gartner and 
colleagues paper in the June 16, 2007 issue of The Lancet concluded that SNUS could produce a net health benefit in inveterate
 smokers. We have no problem trying to convince inveterate smokers to use SNUS. But it would be impossible to limit distribution 
of smokeless tobacco products to these inveterate tobacco smokers. Tobacco companies have an entirely different goal in mind – 
they are already targeting a much younger crowd of young adults and any kids they can entice along the way - witness the tagline for Camel SNUS: "Pleasure for wherever." Another example: Cathryn Cushing, a specialist with the Oregon's Tobacco Prevention and Education Program, "I see it as a young adult marketing strategy, and we have a lot of hip young adults in this city," Cushing said. And "if it appeals to a 22-year-old, I think you can assume it will appeal to a 16-year-old. Because what do 16-year-olds want to be? Twenty-two" (The Oregonian, 1/7/2007) Or a comment from Mitch Zeller, health policy consultant who was director of the Office of Tobacco Programs at the FDA during the Clinton Administration, said the web site for Camel Snus "seems aimed at young adult males to get them to
 start using products." The site says Reynolds found Snus in Sweden, "home of the world's best meatballs, massage and blondes." 
 In Sweden (2004), where SNUS originated, it has been found that the use of snuff decreases with age and was the highest 
in the age group 18-29 years. <font size="4">Click on images to enlarge..</font> (TobaccoWatch.org)

Swedish government budget proposal includes another tax on SNUS..</a> - Swedish Match closed down 4.94 pct at 130, on

STOCKHOLM, Sweden--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Swedish Government budget proposal, to be presented on September 20, 2007, is expected to include a new tax increase on tobacco products including snus,
 which is proposed to be SEK 2,70 for 24 g (pouch) and SEK 5,63 for 50 g (loose). The numbers include VAT and the increase is expected to be effective as of January 1, 2008.
In the light of the recent tax increase in January 2007, where the tax increased by SEK 3,69 for 24 g and SEK 7,69 for
 50 g snus, including VAT, the new tax proposal was unexpected.  (Yahoo Finance)  <font color="FFFFFF" size-4>As Dr.

<font color="FFFFFF" size="4"> Nicotine – in any form – not safe..</font></a> A new study from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City 
provides evidence that nicotine may accelerate atherosclerosis and may be as dangerous as tar. Right now, the general consensus 
is that the problem with cigarettes is tar and that nicotine is safe. That's why you can buy nicotine gum or patches to help 
you stop smoking. Our study presents new evidence that nicotine may not be safe at all, especially for your heart," says
 Dr. Daniel F. Catanzaro, principal investigator of the study, recently published in the journal Cardiovascular Toxicology.
The study found that mice exposed to smoke from low-nicotine cigarettes had significantly smaller atherosclerotic lesions,
 compared to those exposed to regular cigarettes but still larger than lesions in control mice not exposed to cigarette smoke,
 which showed the least evidence of atherosclerosis. The accelerating effects of smoking on lesions was seen early, within weeks 
of smoke exposure. "While our study seems to suggest that low-nicotine cigarettes are safer, we also know that smokers adjust 
their smoking habits to maintain their level of nicotine. In other words, if you switch to a low-nicotine product, 
you will probably increase the number of cigarettes you smoke, or change the way you smoke to get more nicotine out of each 
cigarette. The best thing to do is quit," says Dr. Catanzaro. (Newswise Medical News, Tuesday, 9/11/07) <font size="4">

  <a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#050807a">May 8, 2007</a>.  "Many adult smokers continue to use tobacco and we believe the
responsible thing to do is to seek out and offer products that may substantially reduce the health risks," 
said Benjamin Kemball, President and CEO of Imperial Tobacco Canada. Imperial Tobacco Canada's Edmonton test market
 is designed to assess consumer acceptance of snus. It will also monitor its use to compare it with the Swedish experience
 that it serves as a gateway from smoking. The company will offer its findings to Health Canada. Decisions on future test markets or
expansion will be made later. Although Kemball wouldn't specify exactly why Edmonton was chosen for the test market,

Les Hagen of the lobby group Action on Smoking and Health noted</a> that Alberta currently accounts for 40 per cent
of the smokeless tobacco market in Canada. Hagen dismissed the company's efforts to portray snus as less harmful than cigarettes
 as "a hollow public relations gesture." He said snus will be sold under the 
DuMaurier brand, which will end up promoting sales of duMaurier cigarettes, not discouraging them. 
<font color="FFFFFF">Isn't Imperial the same company that was going to close two Ontario plants and shift production to Mexico

New Zealand to be cigarette free within 10 years.  The priority was to get rid of cigarettes and smoked tobacco. Among steps
they advocated were the removal of retail displays, plain packaged cigarettes, increased tax on tobacco products,
more support for people quitting, more alternatives to cigarettes and the staged removal of cigarettes from sale. ASH NZ director 
Ben Youdan said their priority was getting rid of cigarettes and smoked tobacco by looking for alternatives, especially for 
those most addicted. Mr. Youdan is making a unfortunate public health mistake - the goal should be to remove all tobacco products. 
Most likely, public health officials in  New Zealand when discussing tobacco avoidance speak in terms of smoking tobacco

 cause of death in the United States. Cigarette smoking causes an estimated 438,000 deaths, or about 1 of every 5 deaths, each year.
 This estimate includes approximately 38,000 deaths from secondhand smoke exposure. More deaths are caused each year by tobacco
 use than by all deaths from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), illegal drug use, alcohol use, motor vehicle injuries, suicides,
 and murders combined. On average, adults who smoke cigarettes die 14 years earlier than nonsmokers. Based on current cigarette

The Altria Group plans to spin off Philip Morris International</a>,
 the overseas maker of Marlboros and other cigarette brands, in a move intended to give it more freedom
 to pursue sales growth in emerging markets. The plans, announced yesterday, would leave Altria with its
 much smaller domestic tobacco business, which still is the biggest in the United States. The spinoff would
 clear the international tobacco business from the legal and regulatory constraints facing its 
domestic counterpart, Philip Morris USA. The company’s board announced it would confirm its decision 
and give the exact timing of the spinoff at its board meeting on Jan. 30.  Sales at Philip Morris International,
 based in Lausanne, Switzerland, are more than double those at the United States unit, with 2006 revenue 
of $48.26 billion, compared with Philip Morris USA’s $18.47 billion. Last year, Philip Morris International
 sold 831 billion cigarettes, making it the world’s largest nongovernment tobacco company by volume. 
It holds 15.4 percent of the global market.

August 29, 2007 - An article written by Dr. Sanjit Bagchi in the September issue of <u>Health Care News</u> summarizes a study that 
appeared in the June 16, 2007 issue of The Lancet ("Assessment of Swedish snus for tobacco harm reduction: an epidemiological 
modelling study," by Carol E. Gartner et al.). Gartner and colleagues found snus could produce a net benefit to health at 
the population level if it is adopted in sufficient numbers by inveterate smokers. It was concluded that relaxing current 
restrictions on the sale
of snus is more likely to produce a net benefit than harm, with the size of the benefit dependent on how many inveterate
smokers switch to snus. <font color="FFFFFF">Please note the subjects were hard-nosed, firmly and long established, deep-rooted  
cigarette smokers that refuse to consider trying to quit smoking tobacco. For this population SNUS may help but it is 
impossible to limit distribution to this relatively small number of smokers. Over 70% of smokers have expressed the desire to 
quit using tobacco products.
But tobacco companies have an entirely different goal in mind - targeting a much younger crowd of young adults and any kids
they can entice along the way - witness the tagline for Camel SNUS: "Pleasure for wherever."  We’re afraid this generation of
 youngsters will not be able to reach their full potential – their crutch will always
 be nicotine addiction. Kids are well aware of what is happening.. they’ve been told over and over again how bad tobacco
 smoking can be - it kills. Now – you have public health officials telling people how safe this alternative is and you can still get
 the same amounts of nicotine (perhaps even more) and much lesser chance of developing a disease. Please see http://snus.biz 
for many more examples. (TobaccoWatch.org)</font> <font size="4">Click on image to enlarge..</font>

<font size="4" color="FFFFFF">Britain to put picture warnings on ALL tobacco products..</font></a> All packets of cigarettes and other tobacco products sold in Britain will have to feature graphic photographs
 showing the effects of smoking from next year, government ministers said Wednesday (8/28/07) Belgium was the first European Union member
 state to publish warning photos on cigarette packets, but Britain is going a step further by applying the rule to all tobacco products.
The decision brings Britain into line with nations such as Canada, India, Australia and Singapore. The photos which will be used 
are being selected by members of the public, who voted for the 15 most disturbing from 42 which featured on a website. Ministers will 
announce later Wednesday which ones were the winners, but the options include pictures of cancerous lungs and diseased gums.
A 2002 study from the Canadian Cancer Society showed that 58 percent of smokers said that the pictures made them think more
 about the effects of smoking. In October 2007, the minimum age for buying tobacco in Britain will rise from 16 to 18, bringing it 
in line with alcohol. Smoking in enclosed public places is now banned across the country. (Yahoo News)

 of its ratification by signatory states. China joined the international fight against tobacco consumption
 when it signed the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control of the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2003. It ratified the convention in October 2005 and the convention came into

North Carolina - New Law Requires All Cigarettes Be Self-Extinguishing To Save Lives...</a> Governor 
Mike Easley today signed into law House Bill 1785: "An act to require cigarette fire safety by adopting a cigarette fire-safety
 standard." The new law requires that cigarettes sold in North Carolina be self-extinguishing in an effort to reduce the number 
of smoking-related fires and home-fire deaths. "Cigarettes are the leading cause of deaths from fires in North Carolina,"
 said Easley. By making the change to
 self-extinguishing cigarettes, it is estimated that as many as 50 fire-related deaths in our state could be prevented 
each year." Between 2001 and 2006 there were 2,916 cigarette-related fires in North Carolina. Advocates say the self-extinguishing
 cigarettes could save three of every four cigarette-related fire deaths. In New York state, the first to adopt a ''fire-safe''
 cigarette law, cigarette-related fire deaths dropped from a high of 44 in 2001 to 28 in 2005, the first year after the law 
was enacted.Twenty-one other states have adopted ''fire-safe'' cigarette laws, according to Stateline.org, the online news service.
The new law requires that all cigarettes sold in North Carolina be self-extinguishing and that it be indicated on the
 product’s packaging. A manufacture that fails to follow the law could be subject to a $100,000 fine. A retailer could 
face a fine of up to $25,000 for knowingly selling cigarettes that are not self-extinguishing. The Bill passed the state 
House 109-5 and the state Senate 47-0. It goes into effect Jan. 1, 2010. See related Newsbriefs:

August 26, 2007 - <font color="FFFFFF">Marlboro to be Marketed in Bangladesh - One of the Poorest and Densely Populated 
Countries in the World..</font>  
The world's leading tobacco manufacturer Philip Morris (PM)
 has tied up with a Bangladeshi firm to sell Marlboro cigarettes in the local market, company officials said Sunday.
The Marlboros will be manufactured and distributed by the Dhaka Tobacco Company - the city of Dhaka in one of the lowest
ranking cities for health and sanitation in the world. "This agreement will benefit both companies," Matteo Pelligrini, president
 of PM
 International, Asia, said in a statement. Marlboro's entry into the Bangladesh market is likely to challenge the grip of British American Tobacco on
high-priced brands, though Uddin declined to give a specific price per packet. Dhaka Tobacco, the largest tobacco company
 in Bangladesh, produced 20 billion cigarettes in 2006 for an estimated 
market share of about 40 percent. But the company, with annual sales of around 300 million dollars, dominates here only in terms of the 
low- and medium-priced brands. Bangladesh is one of the most profitable tobacco markets in the world, with annual sales of around
one billion dollars. More than 40% of Bangladeshi men smoke, according to industry figures. Most likely target audience
 - 40% of the population is under 15 years old. The illiteracy rate in Bangladesh is extremely high. Easy targets to convince 
to smoke tobacco. (Marlboros to make Bangladesh debut, Yahoo News - Singapore) Meanwhile back in

the public its a good corporate citizen. <font size="4">Click on image to enlarge..</font>

of either:
2-packs of cigarettes, 1-pack of cigarettes and 1-can of Camel SNUS or 2-cans of Camel SNUS. The representative uses a handheld scanner handheld
 to take a photo of your id, we suppose so they can send you promotions to your postal address. This person also asks about your 
favorite brand of cigarettes and if you've ever tried smokeless tobacco - she then plugs 
Camel SNUS. Raleigh, NC is one of the additional market test sites for Camel SNUS. Reynolds is probably in huury to heavily promote
 Camel SNUS with the big guys coming, that is Marlboro SNUS (being test marketed starting in August 2007 in Dallas, TX). Marlboro is 
considered one of the strongest brand names in consumer packaged good. Marlboro cigarettes had a 40.5% share of the cigarette market
in the U.S.A. in 2006.

win against tobacco giant Philip Morris.The court's 4-2 ruling strikes a hard blow against Tillery's claim that the court should 
reconsider its 2005 decision reversing the 2003 victory Tillery won from Madison County judge Nicholas Byron. Tillery had brought
a class action against Philip Morris, claiming that the corporation's marketing of light cigarettes amounted to fraud because 
smokers weren't getting anything less dangerous than regulars. Byron agreed and ordered the record-setting verdict, 
including $1.8 billion in attorney's fees for Tillery and other lawyers. But on appeal, <u>the state Supreme Court sided with
 Philip Morris's argument 
the corporation was protected from the lawsuit because the Federal Trade Commission had specifically authorized marketing 
of cigarettes as light and low-tar.</u> (

Philip Morris (PM) USA today announced that it will be introducing
Marlboro Moist Smokeless Tobacco (MST)</a> into test

The arrival of Marlboro MST on the market will mark the third stage of a
 busy 15 months for PM USA, which test launched Taboka in Indianapolis during July last year and Marlboro Snus in Dallas/Fort Worth,
 earlier this month. Taboka and Marlboro Snus are both pasteurized, no-spit products that are offered to adult smokers as
 alternatives to cigarettes, whereas Marlboro MST is a fermented, spit product aimed at existing adult moist smokeless tobacco
 users. Marlboro MST, which is PM USA’s first moist smokeless tobacco product, will be offered in Original and Wintergreen
flavors and will be available in Long Cut and Fine Cut varieties. It is expected to sell at about $3.00 per can, which is
midway between the highest- and lowest-priced products already offered in Atlanta.

August 21, 2007 - Cigarette sales dropped nearly 7% last month after a smoking ban was introduced in England. Smokers bought
 6.9% fewer cigarettes in the four weeks to July 28, 2007 than in the same period last year, according to figures from 
consumer research group AC Nielsen. Sales were down 1.2% in June, ahead of the ban. (On July 1, 2007 England introduced a new law
to make virtually all enclosed public places in England smoke free.) Anti-smoking campaigners ASH (Action on Smoking and Health)
 welcomed the news.
 "This is a good sign," a spokeswoman said. "As expected, smokers appear to be cutting back on the number of cigarettes they smoke.
 We also expect many will use the smoking ban as a trigger to help them quit altogether." (
<a href="http://money.guardian.co.uk/businessnews/article/0,,2153243,00.html">
Cigarette Sales Drop Nearly 7%</a>, Julia 
Kollewe, Guardian Unlimited) <font color="FFFFFF">ASH is the same group that
 is recommending the use moist snuff - SNUS like products in England as a substitute for tobacco smoking. At present as a result 
of England being part of the European Union moist snuff is outlawed. The ASH wants this tobacco product introduced in England not
 even considering the consequences of their actions, e.g. another generation of nicotine addicts. This reminds us of the days that tobacco control people insisted that 
tobacco companies produce low tar and low nicotine cigarettes. From Business Week Dec 16, 1967 – The government is interested
in promoting cigarettes with low tar and 
nicotine content on the theory that they aren’t quite as bad for you. Says James C. Bowling, a vice-president of 
Philip Morris Inc.: “Although we maintain that low 
numbers are not proven meaningful, we will make cigarettes that way if that’s what smokers want.” (TobaccoWatch.org)
As Dr. Gunilla Bolinder, director of education at Stockholm's Karolinska University Hospital points out, "To sing the praises 
of SNUS is a deathblow to 20 years of hard tobacco preventive work.
SNUS only saves the life of the tobacco industry" (SNUS gets the thumbs-down NEWS-24 1/31/2007).</font> <font size="4">Click on image to enlarge..</font>

August 18, 2007 - The market test of Marlboro SNUS, a new spitless, smokeless tobacco product, has begun in the Dallas 
Area in an effort to spur sales as cigarette consumption continuous to decline. Philip Morris has said, the popularity of Marlboro
 "may help encourage trial of SNUS by adult smokers." In Dallas, the law is simple - no smoking in restaurants. Now the new Philip
 Morris product will help tobacco users get around that.(

CBS 11 News Dallas, Jay Gormley reporting</a>). Already free coupons are
 available for Marlboro SNUS (Dallas - Craigslist). <font size="4" color="FFFFFF">Our highest priority has to be keeping children from
 beginning to use tobacco 
products.</font> Kylie Meiner,  the tobacco prevention coordinator for Multnomah County (Oregon) 
where one of the two original test sites for Camel Snus is located is convinced that the marketing is aimed at young people.
One direct mail item she received read “Camel Snus – be the 1st on your block to try it” (Portland Tribune, 11/20/2006). The 
European Court of Justice ruled on (December 2004) that an EU ban on the sale of snus - Swedish snuff tobacco - should remain
 in force. Noting the risk that young people would become addicted to nicotine if they begin to use snus, the Court 
said that its decision was motivated by a desire to protect the health of European citizens. (See SNUS.biz for more...) 
Some public health professionals seem to think
SNUS should be used as a harm reduction product in inveterate (firmly and long established) smokers that
 have no interest in quitting, e.g. a paper by 
<a href="Rodu_Brad_DDS_Louisville_pro_smokeless.jpg">
Dr. Brad Rodu</a>and William T. Godshall, M.P.H. entitled: <u>"Tobacco Harm Reduction: 
An Alternate Cessation Strategy for Inveterate Smokers,"</u> from the Dec. 21, 2006
 issue (Vol. 3, issue 1) of Harm Reduction Journal. Tobacco companies are targeting a much younger crowd of young adults and any 
kids they can entice along the way - witness the tagline for Camel SNUS: "Pleasure for wherever."

August 16, 2007 - Reynolds American rejected the anti-tobacco organization (American Legacy Foundation)
claim that its Camel No. 9 cigarettes, which comes in black packages with pink trim, target girls and said it
will continue to sell them. The foundation wanted the cigarettes removed from store, calling them a veiled 
attempt to sell more cigarettes to girls and young women.(Blumberg News)

 Dozens of women's and public health organizations on Wednesday called on R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. to remove from
 the market its Camel No. 9 cigarettes, a brand they say is cynically 
aimed at getting young, fashion-conscious women and girls to start smoking. At the same time, a congressional
 group said it had been rebuffed by major women's and fashion magazines (e.g., Glamour, September 2007, Camel 
No. 9 centerfold - TW) in their effort to get
 the magazines to stop publishing ads for the Camels and other cigarettes. The latest ad campaign 
for Camel No. 9 says "Now available in stiletto" — a longer, thinner cigarette.

NYC Warns Parents of Smoking Lawsuits by Jill Gardiner, The New York Sun</a> -
Mayor Bloomberg said today that he has not decided whether to back a soon-to-be introduced bill in the City Council 
to prohibit smoking in cars with minors. He warned parents though that their children could target them in second-hand smoke
lawsuits if they engage in the practice. "I've always thought, someday, somebody is going to sue. Some kid is going to sue their
 parents," the mayor said when asked whether he would back the legislation. Mr. Bloomberg said he would have to look at the 
legislation before deciding whether to support it. "I will say that if you have a child in a car and you smoke you are just
 really not being fair to that child." See related Newsbrief: <a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#081507b">August 15, 2007</a>.

Sucking tobacco' illegally imported under ministries' noses</a>
By JUDY SIEGEL-ITZKOVICHA, <u>The Jerusalem Post</u>..  A fruit-flavored tobacco product called "Kicks,"
 meant to be sucked for up to 30 minutes for its nicotine effect,
is being imported from Sweden and sold illegally in chain stores and kiosks around Israel despite the 
lack of required authorizations from the
Health and Trade ministries. The Industry, Trade and Labor Ministry cannot authorize the import of
 a food product unless
 the Health Ministry certifies that it is safe for consumption,
and the sale of a food product in Israel without Health Ministry approval is a criminal offense.
It was noted two decades ago, when former prime minister Ariel Sharon headed the Industry and 
Trade Ministry,
 he "adopted the Israeli Cancer Association's request" to bar the import of smokeless tobacco. 
This regulation "does not exist today, or it
was removed [from the regulation books] a few months ago, and that today one can buy - in chain stores and kiosks -
tobacco for sucking." The cancer association heads called on the ministers to "use the powers given to you by law and
prohibit the import of sucking tobacco into Israel until it is stated categorically in the law that the product is safe for use
and does not endanger health. It is important to note that today, sucking tobacco is prohibited for import and sale in all 
the European Union countries and permitted only in Sweden and non-EU Scandinavian countries - Norway."

August 15, 2007 - Smokers have already been banned from New York bars and restaurants, and soon they could be prohibited from 
lighting up in cars carrying minors. A City Council member of Queens who is chairman of the council's Environmental 
Protection Committee, James Gennaro, said he is planning to introduce the smoking bill next week. "I am just seeking every
 opportunity I can to denormalize smoking and to try to put it out of the reach of kids," Mr. Gennaro said. 
"I've lost family members to lung cancer and I've seen what happens." Mr. Gennaro's proposal calls for fines of $200 to $400 
for a first smoking violation, $500 to $1,000 for a second violation in a single year, and between $1,000 and $2,000 for a third 
violation in a year. The New York Police Department would get the task of enforcing the law. Rockland County, NY in June 2007 
approved a measure to ban smoking in cars with minors. A child who spends one hour in a very smoky room is inhaling 
as many dangerous chemicals as if he or she smoked 10 or more cigarettes, according to the Mayo Clinic. A U.S. Surgeon General's 
report from 2006 found there is sufficient evidence to infer "a causal relationship" between secondhand smoke exposure
 from parental smoking and lower respiratory illnesses in infants and children. (

August 13, 2007 - <font size="4" color="FFFFFF">If You Use Tobacco Products Its Going to Cost You More..</font>  
Charging workers who smoke more for their health care is becoming a widespread practice. 
Clarian Health, an Indiana hospital chain, will require workers who smoke to pay $5 out of each paycheck starting in 2009.
For workers deemed obese, as much as $30 will be taken out of each paycheck until they meet certain weight, cholesterol and blood 
pressure standards. A PriceWaterhouseCooper's survey this year of 62 percent of the 135 top executives who responded, 
 said their companies should require employees who show unhealthy behaviors to pay a greater share of their health care costs.
Weyco, a Lansing, Mich., benefits administrator, recently adopted a policy to completely eliminate tobacco use from its 
work force. In 2003, the company introduced a policy of not hiring tobacco users and began offering smoking-cessation programs to 
employees, who were given a year to quit. "While other employers' health plan costs have spiraled, Weyco's have stayed the same,"
 said Gary Climes, vice president and general manager of Weyco.
(Firms dock pay of obese, smokers, Gregory Lopes, Washington Times) Effective January 1, 2002 the Tacoma-Pierce County Health
 Department does not hire applicants
 who use tobacco. Smokers at Scott's Miracle-Gro Co. won't even be able to do that much longer. In October 2006, the Marysville, 
OH based company will begin randomly testing employees and giving pink slips to those who test positive for nicotine. 
The company announced the ultimatum in November, saying it was giving employees a year to quit, and offered to help with
 smoking-cessation programs.

 Study suggests that smokeless tobacco is not a good option for reducing health risks
 from smoking. Smokeless tobacco exposes users to at least as much of a potent carcinogen as smoking tobacco does, despite claims that it is a safer alternative, 
reported Stephen S. Hecht, Ph.D., of the University of Minnesota, and colleagues, in the August issue of Cancer Epidemiology,
 Biomarkers & Prevention. Smokeless tobacco users had 73% higher levels of a biomarker for a nitrosamine carcinogen known 
as NNK than did smokers in pooled analysis of six studies (P&lt;0.0001), they found. (Crystal Phend, Medpage Today)

There seems to be some confusion regarding the use of SNUS. Some public health professionals seem to think
SNUS should be used as a harm reduction product in inveterate (firmly and long established) smokers that
 have no interest in quitting. But the tobacco companies are targeting a much younger crowd of young adults and any 
kids they can entice along the way - just take a look at the ads and the tagline: "Pleasure for wherever." .

Survey finds less cigarette smoking among N.J. teens.</a> Cigarette smoking continues to drop among New Jersey teenagers, according to a new state-commissioned survey,
 although the findings are more mixed when it comes to other tobacco use among teens and access they have to all tobacco products.
The 2006 New Jersey Youth Tobacco Survey found that cigarette smoking among high school students fell to 
15.8 percent -- almost half the rate of 1999 -- and to 3.2 percent among middle schoolers, an even steeper drop.  Both numbers
 were also significantly lower than in 2004, the last time the survey was done, and continued to be lower than 
nationwide rates, according to researchers. The statistics are the first to be released since a package of anti-smoking measures 
was enacted in New Jersey last year, including an increase in the minimum age for purchasing cigarettes from 18 to 19,
a ban on smoking in most indoor public spaces and an increase in the state's cigarette tax to $2.57 per pack,

August 7, 2007 - Regarding smokeless tobacco (SNUS): "What on the surface looks promising could turn out to be a public health
 disaster," says 
<a href="Gregory_Connolly_Tobacco_Control.jpg">Dr. Gregory Connolly</a>
, director of tobacco-control research at the Harvard School of Public Health.Like us - many health advocates 
see the new smokeless alternatives as an attempt to create a new generation of tobacco users. According to Connolly, Taboka, Philip
Morris' 1st smokeless offering, actually creates a craving for a cigarette. Philip Morris' Bill Phelps says a pouch of Taboka contains
 slightly more nicotine than a pouch of any of the 4-flavors of Marlboro SNUS. Bonnie Herzog, the tobacco industry analyst
 at Citigroup, says in a July 2007 survey of tobacco wholesalers and retailer that most respondents do not believe SNUS will 
prompt smokers to quit. Instead, they say smokers will use SNUS in addition to cigarettes. 
<a href="#">
Nik Modi</a>, a tobacco analyst at UBS,Taboka
sales haven't been "lighting the world on fire." A USA Today visit to a dozen convenience, tobacco and Wal-Mart stores in 
Indianapolis found Taboka widely available, often in dispensers displayed near Marlboro cigarettes and priced at $1.20 to $3.80
per pack. Retailers say consumers have shown little interest. Pat Bowman at The Tobacco Shop says, "I haven't sold any at all."
He says even people who had coupons for free samples didn't want Taboka once they knew what it was. "I couldn't give it away." 
In Wake County, NC (where Raleigh is located) where Camel SNUS was launched last month (July 2007), several smokers gave it
 a thumbs-down, says 
Gibbie Harris, the county's health director. Ten smokers in her agency tried it. She says "the women didn't like it at all," partly because 
they found it wasn't entirely spit-free. See related Newsbrief - 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#071507d">July 15, 2007</a>.
 Connolly says the health community should play no part in helping the industry
 expand tobacco sales share by acknowledging SNUS as a  safer product. "We shouldn't be out there promoting harm," Connolly says, 
"even reduced harm." - <i>Hey we're getting to like this guy.</i>(

From SNUS.biz - according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention 44.5 million US adults were current smokers in 2004. 
Of these about 70% (33.3 million) want to quit smoking and free themselves of all tobacco products.
 Most of remaining smokers are older hardline smokers that refuse to quit. Will this latter group of around 11 million 
smokers be the only target group that the tobacco companies try to convince to go smokeless?? <font size="5">NO..</font>

August 2, 2007 - Philip Morris International (PMI) was truly happy they had been back in the Bulgarian cigarette market for a year 
and had already had 6.8% of market share. Unfortunately for Bulgarians 
<a href="#">smoking rates are at very high levels</a> and 
<a href="Bulgaria_tobacco_consumption.jpg">continue to rise.</a>  
It should help that Bulgaria became a member of the European Union in 2007 and has ratified the Framework Convention
 on Tobacco Control.(In May 2003, the member countries of the World Health Organization adopted a historic tobacco control treaty, 
the Framework
 Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), which has the potential to reduce this terrible toll tobacco use takes on human life. Tobacco
 kills almost five million people each year. If current trends continue, it is projected to 
kill 10 million people a year by 2020, with 70% of those deaths occurring in developing countries.) August 9, 2007 - A one-third 
rise in excise proposed. The Bulgarian Finance Ministry has proposed that cigarette excise should rise by 33 per cent next year, 
according to a news.dnevnik report. The rise is aimed at bringing the country’s cigarette taxes closer to the minimum
rate applicable within the EU, though apparently at a faster rate than was originally agreed. (Tobacco Reporter)

July 30, 2007 - <font size="4">Smoking incidence at all-time low.</font>  Just 21% of people in the US said they had smoked in the previous
week when Gallup conducted a poll from July 12 to 15, according to a report by Gallup’s Jeffrey M. Jones. This was the lowest 
percentage recorded since Gallup starting researching this issue 60 years ago, though statistically speaking it is considered 
equivalent to the 22% of 2004 and the 23% recorded in each of 1999 and 2006. Since 1999, more than 50% of smokers
have reported smoking less than one pack of cigarettes a day, and this year the figure was 55%. But those smokers who continue
with their habit are starting to want to call time on smoking restrictions. Asked by Gallup if they felt unjustly discriminated 
against as smokers, or whether they thought restrictions on smoking in public places were justified, 47% said they
felt unjustly discriminated against. In 2001, this figure was about 33%. Also, whereas six years ago 66% of smokers said 
they thought that public smoking restrictions were justified, this year that figure is down to 51%. (Tobacco Reporter)From 
Altria Group, Inc. Reports: 2007 2nd quarter results - PM USA's
 cigarette shipment volume of 45.6 billion units was 3.3% or 1.6 billion units lower than that recorded in the prior-year period.
 In the first half of 2007, PM USA estimates that total cigarette industry volume declined between 4% and 5%, and for the full

July 28, 2007 - Philip Morris is sending a card to tobacco smokers on their mailing list and encouraging them to contact
their legislators to tell them to vote against increasing the federal tax on pack of cigarettes from $.39 to $1.00.
The additional money will provide health insurance coverage for approximately 10 million low-income, uninsured children.
 Higher cigarette prices
 should further discourage cigarette consumption. Life-long smokers die, on average,
 10 years younger than people who have never smoked. Almost 60% of U.S. children aged 3-11 years - or about 22 million
 children are exposed to second-hand smoke causing at least some of these children to suffer from various respiratory diseases 
and other related adverse conditions.

July 26, 2007 - 
Snuff's popularity grows, despite cancer fears.
Three out of four Norwegians think the tobacco product known as snus, or snuff, can cause cancer. Its popularity has been 
soaring, though, especially among young men. Snuff use has been spreading in Norway in recent years.
Snuff's rise in popularity has followed Norway's introduction of laws that ban smoking in offices, restaurants, bars and other
 public places. Many smokers, denied their cigarettes, turned to snuff instead, and producers responded by boosting production
 of snuff in small packets that now are often found under the lips of many young Norwegian men. And women. <u>Studies show that
 around 6 percent of the Norwegian population aged 16-74 use snuff daily. Three times as many in the age group
 16 to 24 are believed to use snuff daily.</u> Researcher think the figures will soon reach 35 percent of the population aged 16 to 24,
 despite cancer fears. A new survey conducted by polling firm Norsk Respons for a state public health program in Østfold County found that 84 percent 
of women and 66 percent of men questioned believe snuff can cause cancer. Medical researchers are split on the issue,
 with some downplaying the risk. Others subscribe to the cancer warnings. "We have strong indications that snuff can lead
 to cancer, especially cancer in oral cavities and the stomach," said Professor Tore Sanner at the leading Norwegian cancer
 hospital Radiumhospitalet. The World Health Organization and American health  authorities have also classified snuff as 
(Snus is illegal in every country in the European Union (EU) except Sweden. When Sweden entered the EU in 1995 it negotiated 
this exemption from the ban because of the popularity of the product among its population. Snus is also consumed
 in Norway - this country is not a member of the EU but is part of the Europe Economic Area (EEA) with Iceland and Liechtenstein.)

Smokers will still be allowed to light up in their homes, cars, at retail tobacco shops, in certain motel rooms and outdoors.
 Smokers who violate the law could be fined between USD 100 and USD 250, and businesses that repeatedly violate the law could

<a name="072107"></a>
July 21, 2007 - on July 18, 2007, the U.S.  Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee postponed a vote on the bill
 - which would for the first time allow the Food and Drug Administration to regulate cigarettes  and other tobacco 
products - until next week.
A version of the FDA legislation released in February 2007 included cloves in a list of artificial or natural flavors such as 
strawberry, chocolate and cocoa that would be banned from cigarettes, largely because they had been used to appeal to children.
In the latest version of the bill, released last week, cloves joined menthol as the only additives specifically allowed in tobacco.
The main beneficiary of the change seems to be Philip Morris which recently introduced a
Marlboro kretek (a Marlboro cigarette made of a mixture of tobacco and clove)in Indonesia.(<a href="http://www.tobaccojournal.com/show_artikel.php3?id=4344">
Philip Morris International (PMI) back in March of 2005 purchased an Indonesian company 
PT HM Sampoerna.)</a>  Indonesia is the main consumer of clove 
and uses nearly 50% of the world's production. The clove is not used for cooking but for smoking. Cigarettes flavored with clove
(kretek) are etremely popular and nearly every male in Indonesia enjoys them. (Also, in Brazil there is a demand for kreteks.)
   The main ingredient in oil of clove is
eugenol. It acts as a local anesthetic and produces a tingling sensation. Some claim eugenol also produces a mildly
euphoric "high", though hard evidence on this effect is inconclusive. The main ingredient in peppermint oil is menthol. Menthol 
provides a cooling sensation when inhaled as a result of its ability trigger cold-receptors without altering the 
temperature. <a href="MethTobaccoIntro.html">For More Information on Mentholated Cigarettes.</a> PM just might want to see how
 sales of Marlboro kretek would sell in the U.S. after looking 
at sales of menthol that have continued to climb

July 15, 2007 - SNUS pouches are promoted as being spitless. Compared with other moist snuff products SNUS has less salt and less water but what is crtical is the placement of the pouch.
<a href="salivary_glands_medline_plus.jpg">The only place the pouch can be placed in the mouth 
without the release of large amounts of saliva is behind the upper lip.</a> 
If for any reason the pouch is moved around in the mouth copious amounts of saliva are released increasing the desire to spit.
There
are several minor salivary glands in the lips, cheeks and tongue that release saliva to moisten the contents of the mouth. 
So the tobacco juices produced slowly 
flow down into the gastrointestinal tract with some of the toxic chemicals settling in your pancreas. (from SNUS.biz -
SNUS increases the risk of developing pancreatic cancer.)

 85% of 
<a href="oral_lesion_smokeless_tobacco.jpg">oral lesions</a> are at the 
location where the smokless tobacco product was placed. 
Another problem is the litter created from the discarding of the pouches. From SNUS.biz - in Sweden where snus originated grimy/scuzzy 
 used snus packets litter the otherwise clean streets and subway stations of Stockholm.  (TobaccoWatch.org) You can't go to a
 bar without seeing people pulling some snus out, the used packets are found everywhere. They stick to just about anything 
right after they've been used and despite the Swedes proclamation of being environmentally friendly they love to throw their 
snus packets against anything and everything. They can be found on the ceilings and walls in just about every subway station
in Stockholm, It is foul. (A Swedish American in Sweden, Friday, October 5, 2007)

July 13, 2007 - ads from the Raleigh News & Observer - the weekly What's Up Section. As we know Raleigh is one 
of the 5-cities that RJR has expanded the SNUS test market - see Newsbrief below - 
<a href="SNUS-newsbriefs_index.html#070207">July 2, 2007</a>. Surely even the tobacco
 control professional that support claims about how safe smokeless tobacco is when compared to tobacco smoking for current 
smokers would not approve of these advertisements.  Tobacco companies will insist that they are not targeting youngsters to 
use tobacco products. But it's a known fact tobacco advertising and promotional items do appear to play a role in an adolescent's 
or teenager's decision to begin using tobacco products (JAMA 279: 516-520, 511-515, 1998). Trends in the use of tobacco products 
 among young people
 follow those of adults. Boys see men using tobacco products and want to do the same -- and the same can be seen with girls and
 women using tobacco products. 
Advertising links the use of tobacco products with being "cool", taking risks and growing up. <font size="4">The tag for Camel SNUS

July 10, 2007 - Tobacco control people feel a sense of accomplishment when the price of a tobacco product is increased. It is well 
known that higher cigarette prices result in lower overall cigarette consumption. (Most studies indicate that a 10%
 increase in price will reduce overall cigarette consumption by 3% to 5%.) But the tobacco companies come right back at you doing 
just about anything to keep a cigarette smoker. Recently, we came across an ad in June 2007 issue of <u>Glamour Magazine</u>
(also same ad <u>Inside Magazine</u>, June 2007) where a 
person gets FOUR FREE
packs of any RJR Tobacco's Pall Mall cigarettes by sending in 4-UPCs from any cigarette brand. (TobaccoWatch.org)

children's health insurance,</a> say analysts familiar with
 deliberations on Capitol Hill.
Democratic lawmakers will push for $50 billion in new funding for the State Children's Health Insurance Program over the
 next five years. To pay for that increase, they must find new sources of revenue or cut existing programs. (USA Today) 
An extra 61 U.S. cents per pack is what American smokers would pay to finance expanded health insurance to about 2 million
 children under a tentative agreement worked out Tuesday between Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee.
    The tobacco tax increase would boost the tax per pack from 39 cents to 1 U.S. dollar, an increase of 156%.

also the federal tax on a cigar could rise from 5 cents to $10 per cigar.)</a>  
It would raise about 35 billion dollars during five years to pay for the largest expansion of the Children's Health 
Insurance Program (CHIP) since its creation a decade ago.  "It really does come down to a choice between children and tobacco,"
 said Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., who originally proposed the 61-cent increase. "This is a 'two-fer.'
 It does decrease smoking, and it does connect public health care costs with one of the drivers of that cost, and that's tobacco."

 decision by entering the smokeless category via a snus product. Almost all (97%) of the survey respondents 
indicated they will carry Marlboro Snus when it is available to them. Herzog expects Marlboro SNUS to be far more successful than 
Camel SNUS. Also it is believed that UST (US Smokeless Tobacco) could suffer the most from the national roll-out of Marlboro SNUS.

July 4, 2007 - <font size="5" color="FF0000">Our children are in danger of becoming nicotine addicts..</font> 
<font size="4">from the SNUS.biz web site:</font> Camel Snus
 tag will be - “pleasure for wherever whenever.”
Mitch Zeller, a health policy consultant who was director of the Office of Tobacco Programs at the FDA during the Clinton 
Administration, said the web site for Camel Snus "seems aimed at young adult males to get them to start using products." 
The site says Reynolds found Snus in Sweden, "home of the world's best meatballs, massage and blondes." <u>Comments from 
public heath personnel in Portland, OR - one of the original test markets sites.</u> Kylie Meiner, the 
tobacco prevention coordinator for Multnomah County where one of the two test sites for Camel Snus is located is convinced 
that the marketing is aimed at young people. One direct mail item she received read “Camel Snus – be the 1st on your block
 to try it” (Portland Tribune, 11/20/2006). Cathryn Cushing, a specialist with the Oregon's Tobacco Prevention and Education
 Program, "I see it as a young adult marketing strategy, and we have a lot of hip young adults in this city," Cushing said.
 And "if it appeals to a 22-year-old, I think you can assume it will appeal to a 16-year-old. Because what do 16-year-olds want
 to be? Twenty-two" (The Oregonian, 1/7/2007). <u>Comment from Metroblogging User</u> - Portland, OR: There are only two drawbacks. 
First, it doesn't take a genius to see what a boon snus would be to underage users. Heck, you could sit in class with some 
in your mouth, and no one would be the wiser. At least when I was in high school, you had the telltale clumps of 'chaw' in 
the water fountains to betray the tobacco user, or at least the worn white rings in the back pocket of your jeans. You could
 probably hide this stuff from teachers and parents pretty easily. Second, although smokeless tobacco saves you from some of
 the risk of heart disease and lung cancer, plenty of smokeless tobacco users out there have developed cancer of the mouth or
 throat, and have had large chunks of their jaws and tongues removed as a result. But that's a hard image to sell to
 sixteen-year-olds, who are pretty sure that they're immortal ("You Snus, You Lose" posted by PAgent at 1:50pm on January 8, 2007).

Philip Morris (PM) to close N.C. cigarette plant..</font></a> PM USA will close its 2,500-employee cigarette plant in Concord in Cabarrus County, 
North Carolina in three years, citing a decline in U.S. demand for cigarettes.  Most local production will move to the company's Richmond, Va.,
 facility, where many of the Cabarrus County plant's workers would be offered jobs, the company announced on Tuesday, June 26, 2007. <font size="5">
The decision
 to close the 2.4 million-square-foot Concord plant is part of a larger plan by the subsidiary of New York-based Altria Group Inc. to consolidate 
its facilities and move more cigarette production to Europe,</font>
 where smoking isn't taking such a large hit as in the United States. The decision will 
leave the 1.6 million-square-foot Richmond facility as Philip Morris' only U.S. production plant. The Concord shutdown will hit the local economy
 hard.  Philip Morris is Concord's top taxpayer;  in 2006, the company paid nearly $5 million in total municipal taxes. Cigarettes can be
 produced at a lower cost overseas and marketed to customers who are not as concerned about health issues as they are in the United States,

June 26, 2007 - Substantial scientific evidence shows that higher cigarette prices result in lower overall cigarette consumption.
Most studies indicate that a 10% increase in price will reduce overall cigarette consumption by 3% to 5%. Youth, minorities,

increases.(Reducing Tobacco Use: A Report of the Surgeon General - 2000). <br><br><font size="4">Did you ever wonder what's the

June 24, 2007 - Tobacco ads now even appears in PC Magazine (June 5, 2007). - UST's latest Skoal Flavor -
 Citris Blend - also comes in pouches. President Nixon on April 1, 1970 signed the act banning cigarette 
advertisng on TV and Radio. The Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) of November 1998 prohibited 
participating tobacco companies from directly or indirectly targeting youth in marketing. The tobacco industry response to
 the MSA was at best modest, reducing proportional allocations of advertising to youth magazines but increasing the 
absolute amount of such advertising (Hamilton etal., Tobacco Control 11:ii54-ii58, 2002).
Studies show that 
<a href="#"> 
tobacco ads continued to reach large numbers of youth</a> but it's difficult to determine 
if tobacco companies were actually violating the MSA youth-targeting ban. The European Union Tobacco Advertising
Directive took effect in July 2005. This EU Directive bans tobacco advertising in the print media, on radio and over the Internet.
Tobacco advertising on television has been banned in the EU since the early 1990s.
The United States should also ban tobacco advertising in the print media to eliminate tobacco companies excuses that they weren't 
advertising to youngsters. It is still true in 2007 just as it was in 1973  - if tobacco companies are to survive and prosper, 
over the long term they must get their share of the youth market (14-24).(Claude Teague, Assistant Chief in R&D; at RJ Reynolds,

Dr. Lynn Kozlowski, professor and chair of health behavior in the School of Public Health at the SUNY Buffalo - one of my

market share. 
The banning or exaggerated opposition to SNUS in cigarette-rifle environments is not sound public health policy." 
(5/10/2007) By
 telling 
hardline smokers that SNUS is not as harmful as tobacco smoke, we are encouraging them to switch but also enticing youngsters
 to give it a try. By doing this they are 
<a href="SNUS_paper_12_2006.html">
encouraging the youth of America to go ahead and try smokeless tobacco</a> that it's
 safer than smoking cigarettes. Already the use of smokeless is higher in young people than in adults. These SNUS type products are
 being promoted to be used anywhere, anytime, anyplace at your convenience and no one will even know.  With no federal regulations
 the tobacco companies are free to market their new smokeless tobacco products in ways that
 encourage kids to start using tobacco and discourage smokers from quitting tobacco use. Our children are being threatened – 
if we don’t stop this push to make SNUS readily available - we’ll end up with a generation of nicotine addicts. R.J. Reynolds

it implies a guarantee. They prefer "reduced ignition propensity cigarettes," often ironically shortened to "RIP cigarettes."

The word on the street – no doubt R.J. Reynolds Tobacco (RJR)
was surprised Marlboro SNUS entry (see 6/9/2007 below) would be available 
in 4-flavors: rich, mild, mint and spice. Executives from Philip Morris (PM) had indicated 
the company has learned a lot from the test marketing of Taboka Toabbcopaks. Meaning using  
various flavorings will help disguise the actual nasty taste of the tobacco. Just take a look 
at USST's Skoal, now with 11 flavors: wintergreen (the original flavor), straight, mint, cherry,
 classic, spearmint, berry blend, vanilla blend, apple blend, peach blend and the new citrus blend. 
Most be a flavor just about anyone would like. We have to remember that RJR on 7/13/2006 - see SNUS.biz,
signed an agreement with Norwegian SNUS company called Taboca - a name very similar to the PM's Taboka. Need a job - RJR is still
stationing representatives in c-stores just waiting to give a free pack of smokes to a person that happens to 
purchase a Marlboro. One more item:  Don’t forget the tag for Skoal Dry  - use is discreet so others wouldn’t notice you’re

<p>June 6, 2007 - Nova Scotia (NS)  - ban on point of sale tobacco advertising (March 31, 2007).
HALIFAX - The Canadian Cancer Society applauds the NS provincial government for the development of strong
 regulations that prohibit the display of tobacco products in retail outlets and the use of signage to promote tobacco sales.
“Removal of these displays and signage in Nova Scotia ensures that youth and children will not consistently be exposed 
to the availability of tobacco products, nor encouraged to take up smoking,” says Maureen Summers, Executive Director of the
 Society’s Nova Scotia Division. Many countries, including Canada, have banned traditional forms of tobacco advertising.
 In response, tobacco companies have made point of sale advertising one of their main marketing tools. 
 Tobacco product displays and signage are extremely important and powerful advertising tools that are left available
 to the tobacco industry. Retail displays also work to encourage impulse purchases by occasional (non-daily) smokers and among 
ex-smokers struggling to resist cravings and stay smoke-free. “Tobacco products, and tobacco company logos and brands, should simply not be visible.
 – out of sight, out of mind,” says Summers. Nova Scotia has become the eighth province to ban tobacco advertising in retail stores, joining Saskatchewan (March 11, 2002),
 Manitoba (January 1, 2004), Nunavut (February 1, 2004, Prince Edward Island (June 1, 2006), Ontario (May 31, 2008),
 Quebec (May 31, 2008), and Northwest Territories (awaiting proclamation). (Lesley Mulcahy, Communications Coordinator,

June 6, 2007 - NEW DEEP DISCOUNT SMOKELESS BRAND (BOBCAT) IS MAKING
WAVES. Bobcat, a new smokeless tobacco brand, was launched recently by American
Smokeless Tobacco Company (ASTC), a small private company. According to
our industry contacts, Bobcat (the motto: "Price gets em, quality keeps em") has been selling out
 in virtually every store
where it is sold.  Therefore, we anticipate potential downtrading pressure on
key brands (Grizzly, Copenhagen and Skoal). In our opinion, Bobcat, which
has been rolled-out in roughly 19 key smokeless tobacco states and is
positioned as a deep discount (4th tier) smokeless tobacco product, could
actually have a greater impact on the entrenched players than investors first
anticipate.  Therefore, we maintain our cautious stance and Sell rating on

When a parent brings a child into this world they want the child be healthy and to live a happy and enjoyable life. Cigarette
 smoke has long been known to cause many different problems. Lung Cancer, Asthma, and Emphysema are just a few of
 those problems. <a href="http://www.dentalplans.com/articles/18862/">
Many mistakenly believe that if they only smoke outside, away from their children and never in the home, 
that the effects will go away. This is simply not the case.</a> The side effects from second-hand smoke can still be serious 
even if you think you are being careful. When you hug your child or even sit in the same room as your child, you are emitting 
harmful chemicals. These chemicals remain on clothing, in your hair, and even yoir skin as long as you continue to smoke and for 
months after you quit. There is no way to completely avoid cigarette smoke from remaining on you if you smoke. Parental smoking is a leading preventable
cause for Asthma and many other childhood diseases and conditions. Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood 
affecting an estimated five million children and the diagnosed cases of asthma in the U.S. are rising sharply up 58.6% between
between 1982 and 1996. <a href="Asthma_Child.jpg">

In November, the ministry threatened to sue international tobacco companies unless they paid the government

 a value on the claim.
The suit will require companies to pay a lump sum of 10 billion riyals ($2.67 billion), plus 500 million 
riyals a year for the treatment of tobacco-related illnesses, the ministry said in a statement on its Web site.
 It did not say what period the compensation would cover. The ministry did not name any companies, but

 products in Saudi Arabia. (Tobacco Reporter)

May 11, 2007 - Smoking to influence movie classifications....
US, Friday, May 11, 2007—Smoking is to become one of the factors considered when movies in the US are given viewer classifications.
These classifications, which determine audience age restrictions, can have enormous impact on box office returns.
But not all movies with smoking scenes will be given an R rating as some people had advocated. An R rating excludes all
 people under 17 unless they are accompanied by an adult, and is presumably intended to stop those under 17 seeing things 
they would not normally see as part of their daily lives.
In announcing the new arrangements, the Motion Picture Association of America’s (MPAA) chairman and CEO, Dan Glickman, and the MPAA film rating system had
 existed for nearly 40 years as an educational tool for parents to assist them in making decisions about what movies were appropriate for their children. “It is a system that is designed to evolve alongside modern parental concerns,” he said. “I am pleased that this system continues to receive overwhelming approval from parents, and is consistently described as a valuable tool they rely upon in making movie-going decisions for their families. With that in mind, the rating board chaired by Joan Graves will now consider smoking as a factor — among many other factors, including violence, sexual situations and language—in the rating of films.”
The MPAA oversees the Classification and Ratings Administration jointly with the National Association of
 Theatre Owners. (Tobacco Reporter) Exposure to movie smoking among US adolescents aged 10 to 14 years: a population estimate. Sargent JD, 
Tanski SE, Gibson J., Pediatrics. 2007 May;119(5):e1167-76.Connection between smoking in movies and smoking initiation among 
adolescents shows that exposure to smoking in popular films is a primary risk factor in determining whether
 young people will start smoking. Dr. Cornelia Pechmann of UC Irvine, has showed that teens were more
 likely to smoke after viewing onscreen smoking.

A recent study in the journal Tobacco Control(TC) found that men who switched from cigarette smoking to spit

(TC, 16:22-28, 2007). Gilbert Ross, M.D., Medical Director of the American Council
 on Science and Health (ACSH) has come out in the favor of smokeless tobacco products. He claims that the time
 has 
past for anyone to argue that smokeless tobacco poses enough serious health risks that its use as an
 aid to cessation should be censored (Smokeless
 Tobacco Lacks Significant Health Effects, HealthFactsandFears.com, May 9, 2007). Ross cites
 the work of 
<a href="Rodu_Brad_DDS_Louisville_pro_smokeless.jpg">
Dr. Brad Rodu's</a> endo1wed chair at Louisville (in tobacco harm reduction research) and his
 research funding were created by 
tobacco companies: U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Co. and Swedish Match AB, who have committed nearly $3.4 million.
Can an opinion from ACSH be trusted?? ACSH has sided with
 big business in virtually every controversy involving corporate interests versus public health. ACSH issued 
a report in 1991 stating that there is no proven link between heart disease and a diet high in fat and 
cholesterol. As brought out by Surgeon General Richard Carmona at this time, any public health recommendation
that positions smokeless tobacco as a safer substitute for cigarettes or as a quitting aid would be premature
and dangerous. <font size="4">Our highest priority has to be
 keeping children from beginning to use tobacco products.</font>

Tobacco targets: Students concerned about free smokeless tobacco offered in bars</a>
By JENN KLEIN - Staff Writer (ChicoER.com). Students at Chico State University (in California) say U.S, 
Smokeless Tobacco Co. (UST) representatives are 
promoting smokeless tobacco and targeting local college-aged residents, particularly females, at bars 
when they are either intoxicated or aren't able to make conscious decisions. UST representatives set up tables,
and give out free cans of smokeless tobacco and free merchandise, such as T-shirts and light-up shot glasses
branded with "U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company." The company also sends out coupons for additional free cans 
to those who fill out a survey. UST people have been aggressive at getting the attention of females to the point 
of advising on how to use smokelss tobacco - even if the person is a nonsmoker. One student noted
that on campus it is becoming a much more popular thing to chew than smoke. Students have formed
the Tobacco Action Group (TAG) to fight this practice and want the Chico City Council to pass an ordinance that
would make the free distribution of tobacco in Chico illegal. 
<font size="4">If you think this is aggressive marketing

Cigarette retail marketing
 practices increase the likelihood of youth smoking..</font></a> A study published in the Archives of Pediatrics and 
Adolescent Medicine (S.J. Slater et al., 161:440-445, 2007) concludes 
that the more cigarette marketing teens are exposed to in retail stores, the more likely they are to smoke, and
 that restricting these retail marketing practices would reduce youth smoking.  Investigator
 analyzed data from annual, nationally representative surveys of youths 14,16, and 18 years old conducted between 1999 and 2003. 
Data from more than 26,000 youths and 900 communities were included. Smoking status was categorized as never smoker, puffer,
 nonrecent experimenter, former established smoker, recent experimenter, and current established smoker. 
Cigarette marketing practices in the community based on direct observation of retail outlets that sold tobacco products.
 Analyses controlled for other factors known to be associated with youth smoking such as age and parent’s education level. 
This is the first national study 
to examine how specific marketing strategies in convenience stores and other retail settings affect youth smoking.

May 4, 2007 - Five U.S. senators asked the Federal Trade Commission on Friday (5/4/2007) to investigate what they say are R.J
 Reynolds Tobacco Co.’s attempts to appeal to teenage girls with ads for its sleekly packaged Camel No. 9 cigarettes.
R.J. Reynolds launched the brand in February 2007. It says the cigarettes are aimed at adult female smokers. But anti-smoking
groups and others have argued that the product — from its name, which recalls an upscale perfume, to the packaging to
 the ads — appears designed to lure teens or young women. The cigarettes come in black boxes with a border of teal
 or fuchsia. They’re advertised in women’s magazines (Vogue, Glamour, Harper's Bazaar, Lucky, Jane, Essence) under the 
slogan “Light and Luscious,” on textured paper adorned with images of red roses and lace. Matthew Myers, president of the 
Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said such legislation is needed to stop companies like R.J. Reynolds from marketing to
 young people. “This Camel campaign is one of the most egregious, blatant attempts to make cigarette smoking sexy, cool and
 popular among teenage girls that we’ve seen in years,” Myers said. (MSNBCThe name, Camel No. 9, according to the marketers, is supposed to evoke ‘cloud nine’ or being ‘dressed to the nines’. The company

Statewide Smoking Ban Fails to Clear North Carolina.</u></a> An attempt to ban smoking in many public 
areas across North Carolina narrowly failed in the  House, as tobacco territory Democrats sided with 
Republicans who called the measure an infringement on the rights of business owners.The House voted 61-55
against the measure. Nineteen Democrats - mostly from counties where tobacco is grown or processed - 
opposed the ban, while eight Republicans supported it. The bills sponsor (democrat Hugh Holliman) urged lawmakers to view the bill
as a health issue an effort to protect nonsmoking citizens from unwanted exposure to smoke in restaurants,
offices and other businesses. Opponents of the bill insisted the measure would criminalize a legal activity
and unfairly punish business owners with a fine if someone smoked in their establishment, while offering 
no penalty for the smokers themselves. House Republican leader Paul Stam, R-Wake, one of the chief opponents
of this measure stated, "The bill is well-intentioned and it may have good effects if passed, but it does not
 respect property rights or due process rights." (Raleigh, NC, wral.com) Tobacco control people are being

April 25, 2007 - Reynolds American Inc. (RAI), the nation's second-largest tobacco company, said its first-quarter
profit for 2007 fell 5 percent, as strength in smokeless tobacco helped offset a soft cigarette market. RMI lost market 
share in the overall cigarette industry, saying its cigarette shipments fell 4 percent from the prior year.
But the Winston-Salem-based company benefited from higher prices and improved its operating costs, officials said.
During a conference,  Chief Financial Officer Dianne M. Neal praised the company's new smokeless
 tobacco division, Conwood Co., for strong growth. Conwood saw its volume increase 14 percent and now owns
 more than one-quarter of the moist-snuff market. Reynolds acquired Conwood last year. "It positioned
 Reynolds American as the nation's only total tobacco company, with operations that compete 
in every major tobacco category," said Neal. Citigroup analyst Bonnie Herzog said investors should be
 concerned that Reynolds may not be able to accelerate its earnings, and she warned increased competition
could hinder Conwood's growth. The company's net income dropped to $328 million, or 1.11 cents per share,
from $345 million, or $1.17 per share, in the year ago period. Revenue rose 10 percent to $2.15 billion from
 $1.96 billion in the previous year. Reynolds American faces its largest challenges in the competitive and difficult cigarette market, which 
faces possible smoking bans, higher industry taxes and additional regulations by the Food and Drug 
Administration. Reynolds also expects industry consumption of cigarettes to drop 3 percent for the year.Though Reynolds lost market share in its cigarette business, the company gained in its so-called 
"growth brands" _ Camel, Kool and Pall Mall. Aggressive marketing, including the new "light and 
luscious" Camel No. 9 brand targeted at women, helped drive market shares and provided additional 
opportunity for growth, according to the company.

 THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS - PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL.</a> Bonnie Herzog, an analyst with Citigroup, wrote 
in a report that part of the loss in market share by the major tobacco manufacturers is the impact

 “is organizationally ready to stand independently” if Altria’s board decides to spin off the unit,
 Dinyar Devitre, Altria's Finance Chief said today on a conference call. Marlboro’s U.S. market share rose
 0.4 point in the first quarter (2007) to 40.8 percent, boosted by a new menthol cigarette called Marlboro Smooth.
 The increase muted declines of 0.1 point by Virginia Slims and Basic cigarettes, while Parliament added 0.1
 point. Total U.S. market share for Altria cigarettes was 50.4 percent, unchanged from a year earlier.

April 20, 2007 - As part of a plan to improve children's health, Gov. Eliot Spitzer Friday called for banning
 flavored or "starter" cigarettes that allegedly encourage youths to take up smoking. The move comes six
 months after Spitzer, as state attorney general, helped to negotiate a nationwide agreement with R.J. Reynolds,
 in which the tobacco giant voluntarily agreed to stop identifying cigarettes with candy, fruit, desserts
 or alcoholic beverage names such as "Twista Lime" and "Winter Warm Toffee."  The company, however, denied marketing to children. "We got them to agree not to market and label in a way 
that was designed to target kids but they are still doing it," Spitzer said, referring to cigarette-makers 
in general. Smoking has been linked to cancer. Spitzer, a Democrat, estimated 700,000 children begin smoking
 each year, with 220,000 expected to die prematurely. "This is a crisis. We must take aggressive action to
 reduce these numbers," he told the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network. Details of the proposed ban
 weren't available. The anti-smoking bill is part of the freshman governor's so-called "children's agenda," which 
also calls for restricting the sale of violent video games to minors, and serving nutritious food in schools.

Japan Tobacco took over Britain's Gallaher Group for US$15 billion Wednesday, both sides said,  in the biggest Japanese overseas acquisition ever.
The move also allows Japan Tobacco Inc., the world's third-largest cigarette company,
 to expand outside of Japan, which has seen declining smoking rates. The takeover of Gallaher, the maker of Silk Cut and Benson & Hedges 
cigarettes, also takes Japan Tobacco into a Western European market, where it now has little presence, creating a tobacco empire

German sales rise in Germany amid moves to impose smoking ban.</a> 
Germans smoked more cigarettes in the past three three months as the country moved closer towards a 
smoking ban, according to figures released Wednesday, April 18, 2007. The Federal Statistics Office said 
24 billion cigarettes were sold in the first quarter of 2006, an increase of 6.8 per cent over the 
corresponding period of last year. Sales of cigars and cigarillos rose 46.1 per cent during the 
same period, while demand for pipe tobacco increased 23.1 per cent, the statistics office said. 
The jump in sales comes amid plans to outlaw smoking in public places and impose a partial ban in bars 
and restaurants by the end of 2007 or early 2008. (EUX-TV, the European Channel). The use of SNUS -
Moist Snuff is banned in Germany - a member of the European Union (EU). The EU adopted a directive as 
early as in 1992 prohibiting the sale of tobacco for oral use not intended to be smoked or chewed thus
eliminating the use of SNUS.

Altria completes Kraft Foods spin-off..</a>
 The Board of Directors of Altria Group, Inc. voted on January 31, 2007, to authorize the spin off of all shares of Kraft Foods

long-term restructuring plan that may ultimately split  the domestic and international tobacco businesses into two companies. The idea behind 
such a move is that Philip Morris USA and Philip Morris International would no longer be constrained by the other. That would allow Philip Morris 
USA to expand outside of the nation's borders into more lucrative markets. And Philip Morris International would no longer be dragged down 
by the messy problems associated with smoking in the United States, from diminished demand to government intervention.

January 27, 2007 - Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell is proposing an excise tax on tobacco..    
Pennsylvania may be the only state that does not collect any tax on cigars and smokeless tobacco products.
Governor Ed Rendell is proposing an excise tax - on top of the existing sales tax - at a rate of 36
cents per ounce of smokeless tobacco and roughly 3.6 cents per cigar. It's part of his "Prescription for 
Pennsylvania" plan to raise $151 million to improve health care. Besides the traditional opponents to a 
smokeless tobacco tax they now have 2-powerful cigarette companies as allies - Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds.
Both companies are test marketing moist snuff products in limited markets, but expect a wider rollout soon. Reynolds 
also owns the smokeless tobacco company Conwood which accounts for 16% of Reynolds'overall revenue. The excise tax on
cigarettes has risen from 30 cents a pack in 2001 to $1.35 a pack in 2007 and maybe $1.45 later in 2007. It is 
claimed that the word 'stogie," a common name for a cigar, is derived from the name of a small town called Conestoga

Maine Tobacco Tax Hike</font></a> - Tobacco industry mobilizes to fight proposed Maine tax hike. AUGUSTA, Maine (AP)
As the Legislature prepares to debate Gov. John Baldacci's proposed $1-a-pack hike in Maine's cigarette tax, 
the tobacco industry is mobilizing to fight the increase that would give Maine the highest state cigarette tax
in the nation. Philip Morris USA and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. are enlisting cigarette wholesalers and retailers
in the campaign. Philip Morris has also provided convenience stores with pamphlets urging smokers to join the 
fight. Baldacci is seeking to raise the tax, currently $2 per pack, to $3. The increase, which would generate 
an estimated $66 million per year in additional revenue, is part of Baldacci's proposed $6.5 billion budget.
(Foster's Daily Democrat 3/2/2007) To those who say the tax would be too high, the Maine Coalition on 
Smoking and Health said Maine would have to put a $7.00 per pack tax on cigarettes to recoup smoking's
impact on state health care (Anti-Smoking Group Pushes For Steeper Cigarette Tax, Caroline Cornish,
WCSH6.com, 3/5/2007).

 <font size="4" style="Background-color:yellow">Snus is the Swedish Alternative to Cigarettes...</font></a> Sweden is just a few days from joining the select group of European countries that have banned smoking
 in restaurants and bars. But unlike Ireland, where the ban upset pub owners, or Italy, where cappuccino drinkers complained 
loudly about having to smoke outdoors, no one expects the June 1 event to be met with much protest here. The main reason for 
this indifference is a four-letter word: snus. A moist, finely minced snuff tobacco inserted under
 the user's upper lip, snus is the Swedish alternative to cigarettes. The substance, which is prohibited in the rest of 
the EU (Sweden got a special exemption when joining the Union in 1995),  has been used widely here for almost two centuries, 
and has grown rapidly in popularity in recent years. As smoking 
is banned in eating and drinking establishments, it is expected to become still more popular.

 STOCKHOLM, Sweden -- Swedish Match (STO:SWMA) announced on February 22, 2005 that it has agreed in principle to acquire all 
outstanding shares of General Cigar currently owned by the Cullman family. Under this transaction, Swedish Match will 
own 100 percent of General Cigar. The transaction is 
expected to be consummated on or before April 1st (actual date April 22, 2005). Currently, Swedish Match owns 64 percent of 
General Cigar, while 36 percent of the company is owned by the Cullman family. General Cigar produces the number
 one selling premium cigar in the United States, Macanudo, and several other leading premium brands in the US,
 including Partagas, Punch, and Hoyo de Monterrey. The company traces it roots to 1906, and has been managed by the
 Cullman family since 1961. Recognised as a world leader in the premium cigar business, General Cigar is the market
 leader in the US, and is one of the leading growers of high-quality Connecticut shade wrapper.

Snus snub for Sweden at EU court..</font></a> The EU court in Luxemburg has dealt a blow to Swedish 
national pride, balance of trade figures, and, depending on who you believe, European public health. The court's lawyers 
recommended that the ban on snus (a Swedish form of snuff tobacco inserted under the top lip) introduced in 1992 should stay 
in place. GP reported that the statement only represented a recommendation, but that it was unlikely that the court would
 deviate in its final ruling later this year. It's a major blow for snus giant, Swedish Match. They had been eyeing new
 markets such as Britain and Germany as smoking regulations across Europe become increasingly restrictive. The lawyer leading
 the investigation, Leendert Geelhoeds, gave two reasons for maintaining the ban: it prevents tobacco use spreading to 
new groups; and it's the only way to protect the health of citizens. For those of you wondering, Sweden craftily 
negotiated themselves an exemption from the snus ban when they joined the EU in 1995. The current investigation
 will not affect this. Swedish snus can be bought legally in Norway - and illegally in Denmark and Finland.
