<font size="4">Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC)</font>
</center>
<br>On May 21, 2003, the World Health Assembly, the governing body of the World Health Organization, unanimously adopted
 resolution WHA 56.1, which included adoption of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). The United States 
joined other countries in voicing support for the convention, which is intended to address the global problem of tobacco 
use, and covers issues such as youth access to tobacco, tobacco advertising and marketing, price of tobacco products, 
environmental tobacco smoke, smuggling, surveillance and research.
<br> <br>  
<p>(The FCTC was adopted by WHO member countries in May 2003. It will commit all countries that ratify it
to: eliminate all tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship within 5 years (with a narrow exception
for those nations whose constitutions prohibit a complete ban); require warning labels occupying at
least 30% of the area of cigarette packs (and suggests 50% or more); prohibit misleading tobacco
product descriptors such as “light” and “mild”; and protect nonsmokers from tobacco smoke in public
places. The FCTC also urges strict regulation of tobacco product contents; higher tobacco taxes,
global coordination to fight tobacco smuggling, and promotion of tobacco prevention, cessation and
research programs.)</p>
<p>As of July 11, 2006 United States is one of the dwindling minority of countries that have not yet ratified the
 global tobacco 
treaty. It seems like the Bush Administration is siding with tobacco corporations like Philip Morris/Atria explains
Corporate Accountability International Executive Director Kathryn Mulvey. The Bush administration signed the global
 tobacco 
treaty with great fanfare in May 2004, but has not given the U.S. Senate an opportunity to vote on ratification. </p>
<p> 133 countries (as of July 11, 2006) have ratified, protecting more than 75% of the world's population. The global tobacco
epidemic is projected to claim 10 million lives per year by 2020. The treaty aims to reverse this trend with provisions
including a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship. The ban is meodeled after regulations in 
countries like Thailand. (PR Newswire, 7/11/2006)
