  <p><i>Background</i>: Cold air stimulates
  upper airway cold receptors causing a reflex depressive effect on respiratory
  activity. Menthol, in low concentrations can also stimulate these same cold
  receptors causing a depressive effect on respiratory activity. Menthol
  cigarettes when smoked, deliver enough menthol to stimulate cold receptors
  resulting in the smoker experiencing a “cool sensation.” The “cool sensation”
  experienced by the menthol smoker can result in a reflex-depressive effect on
  respiratory activity.</p>
<p><i>Method</i>: Literature searches
  were done for the NLM databases (e.g., MEDLINE from 1966, TOXLINE, OLDMEDLINE
  (1985–1965), CANCERLIT, plus tobacco industry documents and hardcopy indices.
  The evidence was evaluated with application to mentholated cigarette smoking.
</p>
  <p><i>Results and Discussion</i>: A logical progression is presented that develops the framework
  to prove that menthol found in mentholated cigarettes may cause respiratory
  depression resulting in greater exposure to the toxic substances found in
  tobacco smoke.</p>
<p><i>Conclusion</i>:
   As a result of
  breath holding that results from the stimulation of cold receptors there is a
  greater opportunity for exposure and transfer of the contents of the lungs to
  the pulmonary circulation. For the menthol smoker this results in a greater
  exposure to nicotine and the particulate matter (tar) of the smoked
  cigarette. This exposure can result in increased nicotine dependence and
  greater chance of tobacco-attributable disease. </p>
