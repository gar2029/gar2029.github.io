Drug Companies are taking advantage of older Americans and the poor
through prescription price descrimination.</p>
<p align="left"> 
A recent study by the US Government Reform and Oversight Committee 
showed that older Americans and others who pay for their own drugs are 
charged far more for their prescription drugs than are the drug 
companies' most favorite customers, such as large insurance companies and 
health maintenance organizations (HMO's).

This study, requested by US Representative Tom Allen (1st district of
Maine), compared the prices paid by pharmaceutical companies' most
favored customers to prices paid by seniors for the 10 brand name drugs 
most commonly used by seniors. 
</p>
<p align="left">
The results of the study showed that a senior citizen (in 1st district
of Maine - where study was conducted) pay, on average,
over twice as much as the drug companies' favored customers. The price
differential is approximately <u>five times</u> greater than the average price
diiferential of other consumer goods.

Other drugs commonly used by seniors that are not among the top ten 
have even higher price differentials. For example, an equivalent dose of 
synthroid, a commonly used hormone treatment, would cost the favored
customers only $1.78 but would cost the average senior (in Maine) 
almost $30.00. This is a price differential of <b>over 1,500%</b>.

It appears that drug companies are engaged in a form of "discriminatory"
pricing that victimizes those who are least able to afford it. Large
corporate and institutional customers with market power are able to buy
their drugs at discounted prices. Drug companies then raise prices 
for sales to seniors and others (e.g., the poor) who pay for drugs
themselves to compensate for these discounts to their favored 
customers.

Congressman Tom Allen will be introducing legislation soon entitled
"Prescription Drug Fairness Act" to try and stop this practice from
continuing. With the drug companies strong influence over the congress
it will be difficult to get this bill passed.
It is hoped the new senator-elect from North Carolina, John Edwards - 
the People's Senator,
will work closely with Congressman Allen to help battle the pharmaceutical 
companies influence.
