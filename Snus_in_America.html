<b><u>SNUS IN AMERICA</u> (from SNUS THE BUMP, Nordic Reach 2007, pg 56-57)
<p>Between the mid-1800s and the Great Depression, over a million Swedes immigrated to America, bringing
with them their yearning for Swedish snus. </p> 
<p>Swedes commiserated about the lack of snus in letters home. The newspaper "Goteborgs-Postern" in 1869 printed one that 
stated: "The real trouble for the Swedes [over here]is that tolerable snus can't be bought for love or money." Nearly
every Swedish enclave in America had its own newspaper, and notices appeared every time a new shipment of snus arrived from Sweden.</p>
<p>But snus is classified as "fresh produce" and must be refrigerated or consumed while fresh. There were no means for
adequate preservation during the Atlantic passages so few parcels from Sweden delivered the satisfaction that 
Swedish-American customers remembered from "back home." Not until metal foil wrapping was invented, and subsequently used by Ljunglof
for his "Ettan", did fresh Swedish snus reach America. </p>
<p>Fond memories did not deter Swedes from attempting to produce their own snus varieties.  After all, the tobacco in Ljunglof's snus
came from Virginia. But the trick of treating and preparing it eluded American tobacco companies, who resorted to adopting Swedish
brand names or buying existing factories for such brands as "Copenhagen" or "Red Seal" (the latter, under the brand Roda Lacket,
being one of Sweden's most popular brands of the day).</p>
<p>Despite the complaints about poor quality by Swedish-American snus consumers, buying and trying new product versions continued,
in astounding volumes.</p>
<p>The result of consuming and flinging aside snus, resulted in literal snus rivers throughout North America. In Chicago 
the usage along Chicago Avenue was so abundant that the street was nicknamed "Snoose Boulevard", as snus-using Swedes 
crowded here in the 1800s. Heaps of discarded snus remains grew on the sidewalks, and it is repulsive to imagine the stench and mire it created during 
sultry summer months.</p>
<p>Neighborhoods in other towns with large Swdish populations had their own "Snoose Boulvelards." Among the most colorful 
was Minneapolis' Cedar Avenue, an entertainment center offering attractions lke dance halls, billiard parlors, saloons,
and shows from Sweden. Celebrations kept beer and snus handy for newly landed Swedes. </p></b>
