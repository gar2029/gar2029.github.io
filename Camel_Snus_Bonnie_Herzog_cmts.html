<h4>Comments on Reynolds Americans Moist Sniff Entry Camel Snus
by <u>Bonnie Herzog, Tobacco Analyst, Citigroup</u> from "Smokeless Is Smokin Hot", July/August 2006, Rennee M. Covino </h4>
<p>“Camel Snus is a very different product than the moist smokeless products such as 
Grizzly and Copenhagen,” says Herzog. She explains that snus (pronounced “snoose”) are a smokeless pouch product which
 is spit-less, containing less moisture and salt than the moist smokeless tobacco products. “The product is very popular
 in Sweden, though acceptance by American users has been low,” she adds. </p>
<p>Reynolds is trying to change that. During the test market, retail point-of-sale materials, displayed at select outlets in 
the two cities, will contain images of the Camel Snus products and indicate to adult consumers that Camel Snus is available
 at that location. Also at retail, Camel Snus products will be housed in chilled containers to ensure freshness.</p>
<p>In addition to being sold at select retail outlets in the test markets, the Camel Snus brand (available in Original, Spice, 
and Frost) will be introduced to adult consumers of tobacco products in age-restricted venues (bars and nightclubs), where 
samples will be offered. Adult smokers who provide proof-of-age (drivers’ license, passport, military ID) and certify that 
they are smokers who wish to participate in the promotion and receive communications from a tobacco company, will be given 
two tins of Camel Snus.</p>
<p>Internet age-verified and certified adult smokers on the Camel brand’s database who participate in the sampling promotion 
will have access to an age-restricted site, www.snuscamel.com. The web site will provide information on Camel Snus, retail
 locations where it is sold, FAQs and a “Contact Us” section. Camel Snus tins will have a toll-free 800-number on them for 
adult consumers to call with any questions regarding the product. A money-back offer is also available to adult consumers 
if they are not satisfied with the product.</p>
“We don’t expect Reynolds to be too aggressive with its pricing, but expect the company to be very creative with its packaging 
to draw in new users,” says Herzog of the snus product. But this is probably just the beginning for RAI in the category.

<p>“We believe the smokeless market could be an exciting opportunity for Reynolds, especially given the company’s existing
 sales force and distribution channel, the very high margins on smokeless tobacco, and the company’s highly innovative
 team,” Herzog asserts. She and other analysts contend that Reynolds is also working on developing a Camel and possibly a 
<font size="5">Kool</font> moist smokeless brand—leveraging the brand equity of both “as a platform to further its entrance into
 the smokeless tobacco products category.”</p>
