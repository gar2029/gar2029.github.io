<b>Arizona<b><br>
By a 54-46 persent margin, voters approved a smoking ban in restaurants and bars where children
 are allowed to enter. Enforcement of the ban will be paid for with a 2 cent per pack hike 
in cigarette taxes.<br><br><br>
<b>California<b><br>
Proposition 86 lost - 52 percent of voters rejected a $2.60 per pack increase in cigarette taxes that would have made
 California's tobacco taxes the highest in the nation. The anti-tobacco initiative received 48% of the vote,
 making it the closest statewide contest of the night, despite over $60 million spent by tobacco companies against
 the measure.

<b>Florida</b><br>

treatment program.<a href="http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061112/NEWS/611120405/1036">

<b>Missouri</b><br>
By a 51 to 49 margin, voters rejected an 80 cent per pack cigarette tax.The proposal, known as Amendment 3 
would have added 80 cents to the 1-cent tax on a pack of cigarettes and tripled the tax on other tobacco products.
It lost by 61,764 votes out of more than 2 million cast. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. spent $5.6 million 
to oppose the missouri initiative. Company spokesman David Howard said the firm was "please that the voters decided 
it was not in the state's best interests fiscally to pass an excessive tax on a minority of the 
population." A spokesman for Gov. Matt Blunt said Blunt was pleased with the amendment's defeat.

<b>Nevada</b><br>
Voters approved a ban on smoking in businesses open to the public other than bars and casinos by 
a 54-46 percent vote, rejecting by a 52-48 percent margin a less restrictive measure that would 
have barred smoking in fewer venues.
<br><br><br>
<b>Ohio</b><br>
Voters in Ohio also considered two measures to restrict smoking in the state. Issue 4, which
 would amended the constitution to ban smoking in businesses open to the public, but exempt 
adult-oriented businesses such as bars, bingo halls and racetracks, failed 64-36 percent. 
Voters instead passed Issue 5, a more restrictive smoking ban 58-42 percent.
<br><br><br>
<b>South Dakota</b><br>
Voters approved a $1 per pack increase on cigarette taxes and an increase in the tax on other
 tobacco products from 10 percent to 35 percent of the wholesale price. The measure passed 61-39 percent.
