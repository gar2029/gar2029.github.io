John Hutchinson  (1811-1861), a surgeon, invented the spirometer. He coined the term, vital capacity, i.e.,
 the capacity for
 life. John Hutchinson was a very precise man and a violinist of some reputation. His exacting observations 
allowed him to learn 
that the vital capacity was directly related to height and inversely related to age. In his first paper 
published in 1846 he 
reported on measurements in 2,130 individuals, including deceased patients (On the capacity of the lungs
 and on the respiratory 
function with a view of establishing a precise and easy method of detecting disease by the spirometer.
 Med Chir 
Tr London 1846;29:137). He recognized that reductions in vital capacity predicted premature morbidity 
and mortality.</p>
<p> Hutchinson
 became a consultant to the insurance industry of London. He recommended that the vital capacity should
 be used in actuarial 
predictions. Hutchinson=s invention was initially acclaimed. AWe have no hesitation in recording our
 deliberate opinion, that 
it forms one of the most valuable contributions to physiological science that we have seen for some time.
 In all future 
But Hutchinson=s instrument was not widely accepted in London or anywhere else and still remains absent 
from most physicians=
 offices and clinics. Since this is so, it is reasonable to conclude that John Hutchinson was frustrated 
when he left his 
wife and three children and emigrated to Australia at age 41. At this time, he abandoned all further
 scientific study of his
 device. Toward the end of his life, he moved to Fiji where he died at age 50, possibly from tuberculosis. 
The British 
Thoracic Society and The Thoracic Society of Australia erected a monument to the memory of John Hutchinson
 in 1980.

<p>The Spirometer and attached flow head function together as a pneumotachometer, with an output signal 
proportional to airflow. </p>
<p>In 1980, it was reported that the vital capacity was a powerful prognostic indicator in the
 Framingham study of 5,209
men over the age of 30. This simple office procedure is a useful predictor of pulmonary disease and 
cardiac failure 
and can effectively select groups of persons destined for premature death. Since the vital capacity 
predicts cardiovascular
 as well as non-cardiovascular mortality, this pulmonary function measurement seems truly a measure
 of living capacity useful 
for insurance and underwriting purposes. (Kannel W.B., et al. The value of measuring vital capacity 
for prognostic purposes.
 Trans Am Life Ins Med Dir of Am 1980;64:66).While not widely publicized, perhaps due to low profit
 potential, clinical studies with thousands of participants, provide 
strong evidence that the most significant factor in health and longevity is how well you breathe. 
The famous Framingham Heart
Study, for example, focused on the long-term predictive power of vital capacity and forced exhalation 
volume as the primary
 markers for life span. </p>
<p>According to researchers Helen Hubert and William B. Kannel of Boston School of Medicine (1981),
<font size="3"> "This pulmonary function
 measurement appears to be an indicator of general health and vigor, and literally a measure of living
 capacity".</font> 
<u>These researchers 
could predict how long a person was going to live by measuring how well s/he breathes. </u>
The study concluded that vital capacity declined at the rate of 9% to 27% per decade, depending on age, 
sex and the time the
 test was given</p>
<p>A 5200 clinical study group – observed over a 30 year span showed that pulmonary function measurement 
is an indicator
 of general health and vigor and the primary measure of potential life span. Lung volumes (FEV1) is the 
primary marker for how 
long you will live. Vital capacity falls with age – 9 to 27% each decade depending on sex and age at the
 time the test is given. 
The long term prediction power of vital capacity is what makes it a good candidate as a marker of aging.
Long before a person becomes terminally ill, vital capacity can predict life span. A person whose 
vital capacity is low is not going to do as well as someone whose is always high. It can pick out people
 who are going to die 10, 20, 30 years from now. (Science News, vol.120, 1981 p.74) </p>
<p>Twenty-nine years after the Framingham study, the same conclusions prevail.  
Lung Function May Predict Long Life Or Early Death 
How well your lungs function may predict how long you live. This finding is the result of a nearly 30-year 
follow-up of the association between impaired pulmonary function and all causes of mortality, conducted
 by researchers at the University at Buffalo. The purpose of the current study was to investigate 
the association between pulmonary function and mortality
 for periods that extended past 25 years, the limit of previous studies. Dr. Schanemann and colleagues also 
wanted to determine for how long pulmonary function is a significant predictor of mortality.</p> 
<p>Results showed that lung function was a significant predictor of longevity in the whole group for the full
 29 years of follow-up. "It is important to note that the risk of death was increased for participants with
 moderately impaired lung function, not merely those in the lowest quintile," Dr. Schanemann said. "This 
suggests that the increased risk isn't confined to a small fraction of the population with severely impaired 
lung function." </p>
<p>The reasons lung function may predict mortality are not clear, Dr. Schunemann said, noting that increased
 risk is found in persons who never smoked, as well as among smokers. "The lung is a primary defense
 organism against environmental toxins. It could be that impaired pulmonary
 function could lead to decreased tolerance against these toxins. Researchers also have speculated that
 decreased pulmonary function could underlie an increase in oxidative stress from free radicals, and we
 know that oxidative stress plays a role in the development of many diseases." </p>
<p>Dr. Schanemann said the fact that a relationship does exists between lung function and risk of death 
should motivate physicians to screen patients for pulmonary function, even if more research is needed 
to determine why.   "It is surprising that this simple measurement has not gained more importance as 
a general health
 assessment tool," he noted.</p>
