<p><b>Raves are high energy, all night dance parties attended by hundreds to even thousands of teens
and people in their twenties. They originated in England and were traditionally  held in large
warehouses or open outdoor area and later moved to established clubs.  In the late 1980s, the
Raves migrated to the United States and in the 1990s the popularity increased and they were
firmly established as a subculture. </b></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><b>Mood altering drugs have invaded the Rave scene. The so-called club drug most commonly
associated with Raves is MDMA (Ecstasy, XTC, X, E, Euphoric, Adam, Clarity, Lover's Speed,
Love Dove, Hug Drug).  <strong>MDMA (methylenedioxymethamphetamine)</strong>, is a Schedule I
synthetic, psychoactive drug possessing stimulant and hallucinogenic properties. MDMA
possesses chemical variations of the stimulant amphetamine or methamphetamine and a
hallucinogen, most often mescaline. Ravers usually take Ecstasy orally in pill or tablet form. <b> </p>
<br wp="BR1"><p><b>Some of the negative effects and dangers of MDMA include: effects start within 20-40 minutes,
last 4-6 hours; produces hallucinogenic effects; chills, fainting, paranoia, depression, muscle
tension - all may be observed/experienced; can reduce serotonin levels in the brain by 90% for at
least 2-weeks (Serotonin affects thinking processes, regulates mood, affects sleeping and eating
habits, moderates aggressive behavior, affects sexual function and sensitivity to pain).; sense of
well being usually enhanced, though may alter be depressed; users often have the urge to rub
their skin, grind their teeth often use baby pacifiers to prevent this (drug effects may persist); jaw
thrusting is common, inciting more tooth-grinding; and users often hug each other and massage
each other's bodies as this intensifies the (artificial) high and adverse effects of the drug. </b>    </p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><b>Typical paraphernalia associated with MDMA use are suckers or infant pacifiers to reduce teeth
grinding that may occur, <font face="Times New Roman">luminescent neon glowsticks</font> used to enhance visual stimulation and
dust or surgical masks smeared with  menthol containing ointments to concentrate the inhalation
of the menthol vapors. </b> </p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">One Raver has indicated that he has never been at a party where there was not a room full of E-tards camped on the floor rubbing menthol ointment on each other. 	 </font></p>

<p>We are interested in developing an understanding of why Menthol has become so popular
amongst Ravers taking Ecstasy and  the mechanism of action involved. </p>
<br wp="BR1"><br wp="BR2"> <br>
<img align="left" src="VicksVapoRub.gif">
<p>The typical comment is that the inhalation of the cool menthol fumes heightens the drug
experience.   It was discovered by Ravers to be a way to strongly intensify the effect especially
the euphoria experienced  of Ecstasy. Many Ravers rub the gel (e.g, Vicks VapoRub) directly
underneath their nose and eyes and breath in the menthol fumes.
Others to further concentrate
the fumes will use dust or surgical masks smearing the mask ...   			</p>
<br wp="BR1">Other Ravers have indicated that the menthol helps them breath easier. Brandon, a Raver, thinks
the menthol is best when  he's rolling (already experiencing the effects of Ecstasy). It opens up
your sinuses (nasal passages) and it feels all tingly</p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p>A 19 year old college student indicated that a smoker smoking feels good with Ecstasy. He
advises to smoke menthol cigarettes while on Ecstasy because it feels amazing but be careful it
is easy to smoke too much.  Another person commented that smoking menthol
cigarettes feels so good when you're on Ecstasy (especially Newports). This person claimed they
smoked so much that night that they had dark green loogies (mucous from the nose). Other forms of menthol used include lozenges and inhalers..</p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p>Another Raver has mentioned that its better to smell the menthol instead of sweaty bodies.
Also, it has been mentioned that menthol may add an olfactory dimension to the experience.</p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Dehydration, hyperthermia and heart or kidney failure may result from the combination of
Ecstasy and menthol containing products. . </font></p>
<br wp="BR1"><br wp="BR2">
<p>A number of factors probably come into play in trying to understannd the mechanism of action of menthol. A
subjective feeling of greater airflow to the lungs may be experienced. The cool sensation that
may occur from using menthol can result in reflex breath holding that may increase the uptake of
the contents of the alveolar region of the lungs including oxygen.</b></p>
