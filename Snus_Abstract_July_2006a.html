<br><br>
02/28/2008 -  British American Tobacco Plc, London-based BAT, the world's second-largest publicly traded cigarette maker, struck its second deal
in a week  (see below 2/22/2008) with the purchase of 
 Skandinavisk Tobakskompagni A/S (ST) for $4.1 billion (2 billion pounds).
<br><br> 
02/22/2008 - British American Tobacco Plc (BAT) will buy cigarette maker Tekel from the Turkish government
 for $1.72 billion to eat into Philip Morris International's market lead of 41% in this nation (Turkey - 8th largest tobacco market, 60% of men smoke).
<br><br> 
01/23/2008 - The Imperial Tobacco Group has won control of Altadis following overwhelming support by shareholders for its €50 per share offer. 
(1 Euro = 1.4498 USD) <br><br>
01/08/2008 - Imperial extends Altadis offer period from January 11 to January 18 the acceptance period of its €50-per-share offer for Altadis,
 which remains conditional upon 
80 per cent of Altadis shares being tendered. Imperial said earlier today that it had decided to extend the acceptance period to give more time 
for Altadis' shareholders to accept its offer.<br><br>
11/01/2007 - Cigarette maker Altria Group agreed to buy John Middleton, the maker of Black & Mild cigars, for $2.9 billion in cash.
<br><br>
10/18/2007—The European Commission has approved Imperial Tobacco Group’s proposed acquisition of Altadis. <br><br>
9/28/2007 - Japan Tobacco International (JTI) plans to close its factory at Linz, Austria, by the end of 2009 - another casualty of the
Gallaher sale. The Linz factory was established
 in 1935, and today manufactures about 20 billion cigarettes annually, including Memphis and
 Benson & Hedges. JTI said the plans would ‘affect’ about 300 jobs in Linz and Vienna.
<br><br>
9/28/2007 - Gallaher Cardiff cigar factory to close within two years. Gallaher was acquired by Japan Tobacco Internation in April 2007 -
see below. The Cardiff factory, which was established in 1961, manufactures about 330 million cigars annually. The decision will 
affect 184 jobs.
<br><br> 
9/10/2007 - The European Commission has said that it will rule on Imperial Tobacco Group's €12 billion bid for Altadis 
by October 4, according to a Dow Jones International News report.<br><br> 
8/16/2007 - Swedish Match AB (STO:SWMA) has agreed to acquire Cigars International, Inc., a privately held U.S. company 
(Hdq: Bath, PA)that
 specializes in the direct marketing and sales of hand-made and machine-made premium cigars and related accessories. Cigars 
International employs approximately 100 people and had sales of approximately 400 MSEK  (Million Swedish Kroner,
6.9 kroner = 1 US dollar) for the twelve month period ending
June 30, 2007.The company features an attractive product mix including Macanudo, Romeo y Julieta, and Arturo Fuente, among
 many others, and complements them with a strong mix of proprietary
 branded cigars and cigars sold exclusively by Cigars International.(Business Wire)
<br><br>
8/13/2007 — Imperial Tobacco’s shareholders voted today at an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) in favor 
of the company’s proposed acquisition of Altadis. In announcing the result of the EGM poll, the company said that the making of its proposed 
offer remained conditional on the approval of the Spanish regulator, the CNMV. (Tobacco Reporter) 
<br><br> 
7/18/2007 - Britain's Imperial Tobacco agreed to buy Franco-Spanish rival Altadis in a 16.2 billion euros ($22.4 billion) deal that
includes debt. The move will join together the world's fourth largest cigarette group, Imperial, and the fifth, Altadis (Alliance 
Tobacco Distribution), and 
close the gap with the world's top three groups; Altria Inc., British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco. (javno.com) Altadis is 
the world's largest cigar company; 
hand-made brands include: Playboy by Don Diego and Romeo y Julieta and machine-made brands include: Dutch Master, Muriel and 
Phillies. 
<br><br> 
4/18/2007 - Japan Tobacco (JT) Group completes Gallaher acquisition.
Gallaher today became part of the JT,
which remains the third largest international tobacco manufacturer but whose share of the world market
 moves from 7.4 per cent to 10.5 per cent. The JT group now claims to be the number one or number two
 cigarette supplier to 10 markets, including Japan, the UK and Russia. In finalizing its £7.5 billion 
take-over of Gallaher, JT has added to its international portfolio of Camel, Winston, Mild Seven and 
Salem, brands such as B&H;, Silk Cut, Sobranie and LD. The acquisition has given it greater expertise
in Virginia blend technology, and it has added RYO (roll your own) brands, cigars, pipe 
tobacco and, <b>importantly, snus</b>. (Tobacco Reporter) 
<br><br>
4/2/2007 - Imperial Tobacco Group indicated that it had completed the acquisition of
Commonwealth Brands, based in Blowing Green, KY, the 4th biggest U.S. cigarette maker (e.g., USA GOLD - 8th best selling cigarette
in the US and Sonoma - 14th
discount cigarettes; other brands: Montclair, Malibu and Riviera) with 3.7 per cent of the $376 billion
 US cigarette market. (Tobacco Reporter)
<br><br> 
3/17/2007 - Altadis rejects takeover bid from Imperial Tobacco. A merger of Imperial and Altadis would unite the 
fourth-and fifth-largest tobacco groups in the world, but the combination would still rank behind Altria,
British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco (International Herald Tribune). Into SNUS - Imperial Tobacco 
acquired on 14 September 2005 a 43% interest in Skruf Snus AB. The agreement includes a commitment to acquire the remaining shares
by mid 2009 and provides Imperial with control of the operating and financial policies of Skruf Snus AB.
<br><br>
3/15/2007 - Imperial Tobacco Group has approached Altadis SA for a possible takeover, according to reports in the international
 financial press. (Tobacco Reporter)<br><br> 
3/07/2007 - Tobacco manufacturer Swedish Match has failed in its bid to get MPs 
(Members of Parliament)from South Africa (SA)to grant its moist snuff product  
<a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/200703070205.html">"snus" blanket exemption</a> from
the legal definition of a tobacco product. Swedish Match argued that snus could help 
smokers quit and was not a gateway product leading to cigarettes and cigars 
(Tamar Kahn, allAfrica.com).<br>3/14/2007
MPs have opened the door slightly for tobacco companies hoping to launch new and
supposedly less harmful products in SA, adding a new clause to the draft Tobacco Products Control 
Amendment Bill that gives the health minister powers to exempt specific products from the strict new laws.
(Tamar Kahn, allAfrica.com)
<br><br>
2/21/2007 - EU antitrust regulators approved Japan Tobacco, Inc. planned purchase of Gallaher Group 
(Tobacco Reporter).
<br><br>

of the Swedish Snus market (2nd only to Swedish Match)with brands 
like Gustavus, Grand and low priced LD.

<p><b>Smokeless tobacco has grown in popularity as restrictions on
public smoking have increased. Smokeless tobacco product sales have increased
more than 30% in the past 10 years. Moist snuff (finely ground tobacco, also called dipping tobacco)products have
 been growing at
4% to 5% for the past five years as smoking bans make it harder to light up in
public places. In 2006 the moist snuff market jumped almost 10% and from 2001 to 2005 the number 
of adult consumers of smokeless tobacco rose from about 4.7 million to about 6 million. U.S. 
cigarette sales still far exceed smokeless at more than $70 billion vs. more than $3 billion (Going Smokeless, John 
Reid Blackwell, Richmond Times Dispatch, 4/9/2007).
As a result of the increased consumption of moist snuff there's now a
<a href="http://southeastfarmpress.com/mag/farming_outlook_bright_dark/index.html">demand for dark
fire-cured and air-cured tobacco.</a>  </b></p>
<p>According to Convenience Store News (7/11/2007), there has been a significant surge in the Other Tobacco Products (OTP) category.
 With bans on public smoking escalating, adult smokers are looking for options to satisfy their tobacco needs. 
As a result, the OTP category increased by over 10 percent year-to- date 2003 over prior year, making it the third fastest
 growing in-store category in the convenience channel. Despite battling such legislative issues as non-self service and 
increased taxes, moist snuff tobacco sales have almost doubled from what they were 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Scandinavia and the U.S. are the world's largest markets for moist snuff. In Sweden  and Norway there are well over
a million consumers - both men and women - who regularly use snus. Consumption in Scandinavia totals approximately 250 million
cans of snus per year. Consumption in the U.S. in 2006 is estimated at more than 1 billion cans per year.  During the past few years,
the American moist snuff market has grown by about 6% annually and during 2006 the market growth rate accelerated to 10%.The portion
packed category in the U.S. is rapidly growing, up by more than 15% in 2006, and now accounts for approximately 7% of the 
cans of moist snuff sold in the U.S.  The growing value-priced segment is a significant factor in growth of the overall stuff caregory 
in the U.S. Retail prices vary considerably, with premium priced products in many cases double the price of value-priced 
products. (source: AC Nielsen) </p>

The Ariva(R) and Stonewall Hard Snuff(R) TSNA levels, as reported in this analysis, also are 25 times lower than those found 
in the Skoal Long Cut product, and 30 times lower than those found in the Copenhagen Long Cut product. Star believes that these
 figures speak for themselves, and that continued expansion of Ariva(R) and Stonewall Hard Snuff(R) distribution and consumer
 acceptance can ultimately make an important impact on the risk associated with conventional tobacco use. One component of the
 company's efforts to meet these goals includes continued development and test marketing of a new flavor of Stonewall Hard 
Snuff(R), during third quarter 2006, that will be known as "Natural".
Monday, 3/19/2007 - Star revealed that, in addition to its efforts to promote its dissolvable
 tobacco brands, Ariva and Stonewall Hard Snuff, it would focus on developing new flavors for both the brands,
 providing better choice to tobacco users in selecting either smoking or using the transitional moist snuff

Chester-based maker of the smokeless product suggests pending patent suit a factor

Intro: Cigarette maker R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. has stopped test-marketing an alternative tobacco product manufactured by
 a Virginia
 company. Chester-based Star Scientific Inc. said yesterday that it was notified by Reynolds last week that its test market 
of Star's "hard snuff" smokeless tobacco product was "deemed unsuccessful" and has been terminated.
Star, a maker of discount cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, signed an agreement in April 2001 with Brown & Williamson
 Tobacco Corp., then based in Louisville, Ky., to test-market the product, a spitless tobacco lozenge advertised 
as an alternative to cigarettes. B&W; began selling the product in Louisville last year, initially under the brand name

<h3><b><a name="HIGHEST"><u>HIGHEST PRIORITY - Keeping Kids from Using Tobacco Products</u></a></b></h3>
<p><b><font color="#ff0000" size="5">Our highest priority
has to be keeping children from beginning to use tobacco products.</font> 
Except for Sweden snus (moist snuff) is outlawed by the European Union
mainly because it was deemed an attraction to children, who would become easily 
hooked and move on to cigarettes. (Other countries where smokeless tobacco products are banned including
moist snuff are New Zealand, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Switzerland and Israel (S Chapman, 
Public health advocacy and tobacco control: making smoking history, Oxford: Blackwell 2007).
As Dr. Richard Carmona, 17th Surgeon General of the 
United States has stated, "Young people
may be especially attracted to smokeless tobacco if they perceive it to be safer
than cigarettes. The evidence is clear that the use of smokeless tobacco is a gateway
to cigarettes." "Smokless tobacco is a threat to our nation's public health, 
<a href="http://www.house.gov/schakowsky/press2003/pr06_03_2003smoke.html">
especially to the health of our children</a>," -
U.S. Representative Jan Schakowsky, June 3, 2003.</b></p><b> 
</b><p><b>Kids are well aware of what is happening.. theyâ€™ve been told over and over again how bad tobacco smoking can  be  -  it kills.
 Now - you have public health officials telling people how safe this alternative is and you can still get the same
 amounts of
 nicotine 
(perhaps even more) and much lesser chance of developing a disease. Nicotine addict - studies show after a few cigarettes - the 
average person starts being addicted to nicotine.
Smokeless tobacco delivers a high amount of nicotine. Patricia Richter of the CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health. ‘‘The amount 
of nicotine absorbed per dose from using smokeless tobacco is greater than the amount of nicotine absorbed from smoking 
one cigarette.’’ An average dose of nicotine for snuff is 3.6mg, for chewing tobacco 4.6mg
 and 1.8mg for cigarettes (ACS). 
 Many fear that by endorsing smokeless tobacco as an alterative to tobacco smoking will draw in
 lots of new customers - the youth of America.</b></p>
<p><b>Weâ€™re afraid this generation of youngsters will not be able to
reach their full potential - their crutch will always be nicotine
addiction. In addition, tobacco is considered to be as gateway drug
which may lead to alcohol, marijuana and illegal drug use. One study
found that snuff consumers consume more alcohol that those that smoke
cigarettes (Wickholm S et al., Community Dent Oral Epidemiol. 31(4): 265-274, 2003).
 Another study found that the nicotine in smokeless tobacco
reduces an individuals ability to perform complex tasks that require
hand and body movements to adjust to new visual feedback. Donâ€™t you
want your child to reach their full potential instead of relying on
abused drug to satisfy their addiction the rest of their lives??</b></p>
<p><b>The European Court of Justice ruled on (December 2004) Tuesday
that an EU ban on the sale of snus - Swedish snuff tobacco - should
remain in force. Noting the risk that young people would become
addicted to nicotine if they begin to use snus, the Court said that its
decision was motivated by a desire to protect the health of European
citizens.
A lethal dose of nicotine, a neurotoxin used as a insecticide, is
contained in as little of three cigarettes - only a fraction
of the nicotine contained in a cigarette is actually released into the
smoke. There are stories about how people have fallen asleep with the
pouch left inside their mouth. - higher amounts of nicotine in pouch
then cigarettes. 
In Sweden, an average SNUS user did so for 13 hours a day, and some nicotine-addicted
users even kept a pouch under their lip when they went to sleep, so they 
would not wake up a 4:00am with a craving (Dr. Gunilla Bolinder, director of education at Stockholm's
Karolinska University Hospital, SNUS gets the thumbs-down News-24 1/31/2007).   </b></p><b> 
</b><p><b><u>No federal regulations in place</u>
- tobacco products remain virtually unregulated in the
 United States. Without federal
regulations <b>for our kids sake</b> - we must say no to SNUS. A bill giving the FDA the authority to
regulate tobacco products failed to pass congress in 2004. An identical FDA
legislation was reintroduced in March 2005 and is still pending. The proposed
FDA legislation would regulate the sale, marketing and manufacture of all
tobacco products. It would also prohibit all flavorings in cigarettes except
menthol. As Matthew Myers, Campaign for Tobacco Free
Kids, points out - &#8220;with the absence of FDA authority over tobacco products - 
the tobacco companies are free to
market their new smokeless tobacco products in ways to encourage kids to start
using tobacco and discourage smokers from quitting tobacco entirely. If Senate Bill 666 
(DeWine-Kennedy Bill)had already been enacted to regulate tobacco products it would 
ensure that the marketing of each smokeless product did not discourage current tobacco 
users from quitting or encourage new users to start. On Thursday (2/15/2007) congressional lawmakers 
renewed (reintroduced legislation)a push for federal regulation of tobacco, a step they say is needed to deter children
from lighting up and to get smokers to quit (The News & Observer 2/16/2007).
On Tuesday (2/27/2007), the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee is scheduled to hold 
a hearing on the legislation, opening a new battle in the tobacco wars. The legislation, aimed at combating 
youth smoking, would give the FDA authority to restrict tobacco manufacturing, sales and marketing.
(FOR YOUTH ALL TOBACCO PRODUCTS NOT JUST CIGARETTES)
An op-ed piece by Dr. Alan Blum
(Director of the University of Alabama's Center for the Study of Tobacco and Society) argued that the 
legislation would give No. 1 cigarette-maker Philip Morris "a virtual monopoly" in the current cigarette market
 and continue to furnish special protection for the company. "The fact that Philip Morris is supporting 
the bill is strong evidence it's not good for the public health," said Stanton Glantz, director of the 
Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California at San Francisco. "It needs 
to be fixed to the point that PM doesn't support it," Glantz said (Tobacco Control Bill Gets Hearing by Peter 
Hardin, Richmond Times-Dispatch 2/26/2007). </p>
<p>In Sweden snus is regulated as a food product.
Sanitation requirements in Swedish snus factories are the same as those used in
food production. All additives are approved as food additives. (Although snus is not a food, in Sweden
 it is currently governed by the food legislation. This means that the ingredients used in snus must 
be approved according to the food legislation and the same stringent hygiene demands as for the 
manufacture of foodstuffs is imposed, and adhered to.)  </b></p>
<p><b> Even Chris Proctor, Head of Science and
Regulation for British American Tobacco has stated, &#8220;Weâ€™re also responding to public health stakeholders
who told us they believe snus, <font size="4">properly regulated</font>, can contribute to reducing
the impact of tobacco on public health. We hope more stakeholders, including
governments, will agree.&#8221; Hyland et al. (Addictive Behaviors 31:1190-1200, 2006) have concluded that only 
<u>under strict regulations</u>
the increase in low-nitrosamine smokeless tobacco use could reduce overall smoking prevalence yielding 
potentially substantial health benefits. <br> 
Kids would just love this feature, e.g., with Skoal Dry discreet so others wouldn't notice you're enjoying it.
 <br>  
 <font color="#ff0000" size="4">Well - at the
present time we have no federal regulations on tobacco products in the USA.</font> 
<br> 
</b></p><h3><b><a name="Tobacco" companies=""><u>Tobacco Companies Claim Targeting Current Smokers</u></a></b></h3><b> 
</b><p><b>Philip Morris in the Taboka Fact Sheet states at least three
times that this product is for adult smokers interested in smokeless tobacco
alternatives to smoking. But is this true - they provide information for
parents to convince your child not to smoke yet have promotions to 
<a href="#" onmouseover="doTooltip(event,19)" onmouseout="hideTip()">buy one

making it easier for kids to afford to buy
cigarettes. Their international record especially in developing countries is
disgraceful, e.g., Philip Morris recently made headlines in the Ukraine after
releasing a billboard featuring a pregnant woman or how about Philip Morris
concerts in Niger where kids as young as 10 were given free cigarettes.
In Indonesia, Dji Sam Soe, Philip Morris-owned Sampoerna's flagship best-selling brand, 
has twice the amount of nicotine and three times the amount of tar of
 a conventional cigarette.</b></p>
<p><b>We all know that Reynolds American doesnâ€™t even care if they knowingly
market indirectly to kids. They have been masking the regular tobacco flavor
and scent in favor of flavored cigarettes ranging from watermelon (&#8220;Beech Breezer&#8221;)
to berry (&#8220;Bayou Blast&#8221;) to pineapple and coconut (&#8220;Kauai Kolada&#8221;) to make it
even more appealing for youngsters to take the initial puff and keep smoking
until he or she gets hooked. Reynolds
has been aggressively targeting the youth and young adult market with several
recent marketing campaigns that seek to link smoking with alcohol use, gambling
and rebellious behavior. The report details how R.J. Reynolds recently sold
alcohol- flavored cigarettes as limited edition brands of an ongoing line of
flavored cigarettes called Camel Exotic Blends. Included were packs of
cigarettes with names such as Screwdriver Slots, SnakeEyes Scotch and Blackjack
Gin.
Take a look at one of our modules - <a href="Brown_Williamson_Kool.html">
Prevent Tobacco Advertising to Our Youth</a> - 
and you decide whether or not cigarette makers are targeting our <b><font size="4">Future - the Youth of America.</font></b>
Results of recent surveys indicate that the flavored cigarettes are especially popular among smokers under the age of 25.  
The studies showed that 20 percent of smokers ages 17 to 19 smoked flavored cigarettes in the past 30 days while only 6 percent
 of smokers over the age of 25 did. 
 Each day more than 5,000 kids under 18 try their first cigarette, and more than 2,000 become established daily smokers. 
 Anti-smoking advocates are concerned that flavored cigarettes will appeal to the under-18 demographic, which tobacco companies 
have long targeted with marketing campaigns including images of hip-hop culture, women, and the now retired "Joe Camel."  Under
 the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement with the states, tobacco companies were prohibited from using cartoon images.  Since that 
time, marketing of candy-flavored cigarettes has surged. Although legislation has been introduced in Congress in an effort
 to regulate the tobacco industry, so far no bills have survived the legislative process.  In March  2005, a new bill 
that if enacted, will immediately prohibit candy and fruit-flavoring in cigarettes and give the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) power to regulate the industry. (American Lung Association, Tobacco Policy Trend Alert, July 26, 2005).

again and ensure the company acts responsibly to help protect children from starting a deadly habit.” Under the settlement,
 RJR agreed to a ban in the United States of its flavored Camel, Kool and Salem cigarettes. The agreement also imposes significant

(involuntary smoking) R.J. Reynolds Tobacco said in a statement on its Web site,
"It seems unlikely that second-hand smoke presents any significant harm to 
otherwise healthy nonsmoking adults; and, given the extensive smoking bans 
and restrictions that have already been enacted, nonsmokers can easily avoid 
exposure to second-hand smoke."  </b></p><b>

Mitch Zeller</a>, a health policy consultant who was director of the
Office of Tobacco Programs at the FDA during the Clinton Administration,

Kylie Meiner</a>, the tobacco prevention coordinator for 
Multnomah County where one of the two test sites for Camel Snus is located is convinced that the marketing 
is aimed at young people. One direct mail item she received read “Camel Snus – be the 1st on your block to
 try it” (Portland Tribune, 11/20/2006).  Cathryn Cushing, a specialist with the Oregon's Tobacco Prevention and Education
 Program, "I see it as a young adult marketing strategy, and we have a lot of hip young adults in this city," Cushing said. 
And "if it appeals to a 22-year-old, I think you can assume it will appeal to a 16-year-old. Because what do 16-year-olds 
want to be? Twenty-two" (The Oregonian, 1/7/2007). Comment from Metroblogging User - Portland, OR: There are only
two drawbacks. First, it doesn't take a genius to see what a boon snus would be to underage users. Heck, you
could sit in class with some in your mouth, and no one would be the wiser. At least when I was in high school, 
you had the telltale clumps of 'chaw' in the water fountains to betray the tobacco user, or at least the worn 
white rings in the back pocket of your jeans. You could probably hide this stuff from teachers and parents 
pretty easily. Second, although smokeless tobacco saves you from some of the risk of heart disease and lung 
cancer, plenty of smokeless tobacco users out there have developed cancer of the mouth or throat, and have had
large chunks of their jaws and tongues removed as a result. But that's a hard image to sell to sixteen-year-olds,
who are pretty sure that they're immortal ("You Snus, You Lose" posted by PAgent at 1:50pm on January 8, 2007).

of its employees for refusing to take a test that determines whether they smoke cigarettes. 
Weyco Inc., a health benefits administrator based in Okemos, MI adopted this policy January 1, 2005 
that allows employees to be fired if they smoke even if the smoking happens after business hours or at home.
The company cites concerns over rising healthcare costs for those that smoke. "Wyco Inc. is a non-smoking 
company that strongly supports its employees in living healthy lifestyles."(TheBostonChannel.com, 1/25/2005).
Effective January 1, 2002, as a part of our public health policy, and because of the known effects tobacco use 
has on our community, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department does not hire applicants who use tobacco.
Smokers at Scott's Miracle-Gro Co. won't even be able to do that much longer. In October 2006, the Marysville, OH 
based company will begin randomly testing employees and giving pink slips to those who test positive for nicotine.
The company announced the ultimatum in November, saying it was giving employees a year to quit, and offered to help
with smoking-cessation programs. Scott's officials say it's part of a larger effort to help their employees become
healthier (Clock ticking down for smokers at Scott's Miracle-Grow, Susan Deutschle, Business First of Columbus,

Big tobacco companies are not going to give up. Reynolds American plans to spend
$40-million to defeat proposed smoking bans in Arizona and Ohio as well as efforts to raise
state cigarette taxes in California (is the single largest domestic market, accounting for about 6% of cigarette sales) 
and Missouri. On the ballot in November,2006 the measure
in California calls for a 300% increase in the state tobacco tax to $3.47 a pack from
the current 87 cents. (By the way - a similar increase would apply to cigars and other 
tobacco products - snus.)
Philip Morris USA has invested about (so far) 
$1.4-million in two communities opposed to the California measure to boost state taxes on cigarettes. 
Missouri's tax increase will go from 17 cents a pack (second lowest in the nation, South Carolina
has the lowest at 7 cents tax on a pack) in November,2006 (2006) to 97 cents and 
raise taxes on other tobacco products by 20%. October 11, 2006 - Peggy Roberts, a spokeswoman
for Philip Morris, said the company has begun consumer and vendor campaigns to defeat a $1-a-pack tax
in South Dakota and the 80-cent-a-pack increase in Arizona. Also tobacco companies like Reynolds try to confuse voters. 
In Ohio, voters are considering two smoking-related measures. SmokeFreeOhio would change state statutes to ban
smoking in most buildings other than private homes and a certain percentage of hotel rooms. This one is supported
health charities. A rival proposal, backed by Reynolds and a group called Smoke Less Ohio also purports to restrict 
smoking, through a constitutional amendment. But it would exempt restaurants, bars, bowling alleys and similar
establishments, unwinding more restrictive existing municipal bans. Tracy Sabetta, of SmokeFreeOhio, admitted her group
may have been politically outmaneuvered when it decided to pursue its measure as a statutory change in state law 
rather than a constitutional amendement. "We could get 90% of the vote and theirs (Reynolds measure) could still 
trump ours," she said(The Wall Street Journal, Christopher Cooper).

<p>CLOSE VOTE (Tuesday, November 7, 2006): California Proposition 86 lost, received 48% of the vote, making it the 
closest statewide contest of the night, despite over $60 million spent by tobacco companies against
 the measure. A tobacco tax measure was also defeated in Missouri, but others passed in Arizona and South Dakota. 
Ohio, Arizona and Nevada will become the 15th, 16th and 17th states to implement comphrehensive smoke-free legislation.
 The other 14 states (as of 11/9/2006) are: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii (effective Nov. 16),
 Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont and Washington (the Montana and Utah laws extend 
to bars in 2009, while the Washington DC law does so on January 1, 2007) and Puerto Rico. Two other states – Florida and Idaho – 
have smoke-free laws that
 exempt only stand-alone bars. Hundreds of cities and counties have also passed strong smoke-free laws.

<p><b>Tobacco companies lack creditability so not many people will believe them when they promote smokeless tobacco as a safer
 alternative than smoking.  (will have branch to highlights) (The level of trust with the tobacco industry is virtually nil,
 and if this is the industry we're going to rely upon to come up with safer products, we are going to be very, very cautious, 
very cautious," said Maureen Connelly of the Harvard School of Public Health.)</b></p>
<p><b>So these companies are prodding public health officials to come forward and support claims about how safe smokeless tobacco is 
when compared to tobacco smoking. If this wouldnâ€™t happen tobacco companies before they could advertise smokeless as a harm 
reduction product would have to provide proof to the Federal Trade Commission.</b></p>
<p><b>Certain public health professionals have played right into their
hands and have even been outspoken on how safe smokeless tobacco is
compared to tobacco smoking. One fellow described as tobacco-policy
expert David Sweanor, who teaches law and
medicine at the University of Ottawa, puts it, "It's the smoke,
stupid." But even Philip Morrisâ€™s (USA) Taboka Fact Sheet points out
that smokeless tobacco products are addictive and cause serious
disease. The U.S. Surgeon General and other public health authorities
have determined that smokeless tobacco products: cause serious diseases
such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and other diseases of the mouth,
gums and teeth; may increase the risk of serious diseases when used in
combination with smoking; cause adverse reproductive effects and should
not be used during pregnancy; and are not a safe alternative to
smoking. Philip Morris USA points out that smokeless tobacco product
users and potential smokeless tobacco product users should rely on
these messages in making all tobacco-use related decisions.</b></p>
<p><b>Public health researchers have come up with various percentages on just how safe going smokeless is compared to smoking. 
Some say 99% safer others at least 90%  reduction in relative risk using 
<a href="nitrosamines.html">low-nitrosamine</a> smokeless tobacco use. (branch

, Ph.D., MAppSci., MA - Director of the Tobacco Dependence Program at the University of Medicine and Dentistry 
of New Jersey, has stated:  "In comparison with smoking, experts perceive at least a 90 % reduction in the relative risk" 
of 
<a href="nitrosamines.html">low-nitrosamine</a> smokeless-tobacco use. 
This makes sense, since it is the 4,000 ingredients in the smoke that make a 
cigarette so lethal.&#8221;  Well - smokeless tobacco even without burning has over 2,000 ingredients. Dr.Foulds has stated that
smoking a cigarette, though, was not the same as using a smokeless tobacco pouch. The way in which nicotine is delivered makes 
all the difference, he says. "You can't beat a cigarette for nicotine delivery. It's much faster and in a more concentrated
form," Foulds said. "Cigarettes are like a Ferrari, and the [smokeless] pouch is like a secondhand Ford." For tobacco smoking it
takes about 10 seconds for nicotine to reach the brain but for smokeless tobacco it may take over a minute. 
<font size="4">Will this difference cause the smokeless tobacco user to switch back to tobacco smoking when possible.</font>  Maybe this delay in
reaching active sites within the brain will not be sufficient to provide that instead reward for the nicotine addict. The smoker
that is now using smokeless tobacco may switch back to tobacco smoking but now smoking even more cigarettes per day than before.
Nicotine absorption, frequency and speed seem to have a direct relationship with how strong dependence and tolerance if any
might be created. 
 </b></p>
<p><b>Dr. Scott Tomar (DMD, MPH, Dr.PH, University of Florida, College of Dentistry) has found that many smokers who take up the 
use of snuff in an effort to quit instead end up asking for both products. In addition, he found that nonsmokers who use snuff 
are more likely than those who donâ€™t to eventually begin smoking. &#8220;Men were more than 2.5 times as likely to have switched from
 snuff to cigarettes than to have switched from cigarettes to snuff,&#8221; said Dr. Tomar.</b></p>
<p><b>What if smokers switch to smokeless tobacco only to find out itâ€™s not a satisfactory alternative. Smokeless tobacco usually has
 a higher concentration of nicotine and most likely higher pH so it can be more readily absorbed from the oral mucosa. However 
- it takes around a minute for sufficient levels to active sites within the brain compared to nicotine from inhaled smoke being 
absorbed in the lungs taking 10 seconds. </b></p>

</b><p><b>Smokeless tobacco will reduce the incidence of respiratory
disease including lung cancer and the effects of secondhand smoke. But
regarding heart disease the use of smokeless tobacco is definitely a
major factor. Just look at the acute effects of nicotine.
Immediate after exposure to nicotine, there is a &#8220;rush&#8221; caused in part
by the drugâ€™s stimulation of the adrenal glands and resulting in a
discharge of epinephrine (adrenaline). The result of epinephrine
release causes a sudden release of glucose, as well as an increase in
blood pressure, respiration and heart rate. Nicotine also suppresses
insulin output from the pancreas. (In fact, side effects, such as
nausea and blood vessel constriction, have plagued attempts to test
nicotine on patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and
other maladies in which, studies indicate, nicotine could alleviate
some symptoms.) These responses to nicotine uptake occurring most
likely several times a day most have an overall negative effect on a
smokeless tobacco users cardiovascular system. In a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover designed study was carried
out with healthy volunteers to find the hemodynamic and autonomic
effects of smokeless tobacco. It was found that smokeless tobacco is a
powerful autonomic and hemodynamic stimulus increasing blood pressure
on average by 10mmHg, heart rate 16 beats/minute and adrenaline blood
level by 50%. It was concluded snuff tobacco has a
powerful stimulant effect but that it also dampens the body's normal
protective responses to blood pressure elevation. (Wolk, R et al. , J
Am Coll Cardiol 45(6 - March 15) : 910-4, 2005)</b></p>

<p><b>Bolinder et al. (1992) showed that middle aged snus users had a significantly higher risk of mild hypertension (diastolic blood 
pressure &gt;90 mmHg or systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg) than middle aged non-tobacco users. In a prospective cohort study
 comprising a large number of construction workers Bolinder et al. (1994) found an association between snus use and increased
 risk of death from all cardiovascular diseases for the age group 35-45 years but not for the age group 55-65 years. 
A study by Bolinder et al. showed a 40% increased risk of cardiovascular death among snus users. This study was a prospective
 cohort study of 235,036 industry employees, who were followed for cause-specific mortality during a 12-year period. The risk
 for cardiovascular death was even more pronounced among men aged 35 to 54 years old. This risk for cardiovascular death
 increased by 110% for snus users compared to non-tobacco users. (Bolinder et al. Am J Public Health 84: 339-404, 1994). There 
are few small case-controlled studies that have failed to show a significant cardiovascular risk among snus user.
 (Huhtasaari et al., J Am Coll Cardiology 34:1784-1790, 1999.) 
A Swedish study finds that people who use snuff are more likely to be overweight and to have high blood pressure and high
 cholesterol. Many people have turned to Swedish moist snuff or snus as a substitute for cigarettes. Researchers tracked 
16,500 people in Västerbotten in northern Sweden and found that heavy snuff users were four times as likely to suffer from 
"metabolic syndrome," a cluster of symptoms that contribute to heart disease. Margareta Norberg, one of the scientists, 
said snuff is still better than cigarettes -- but that doesn't mean people should use snus to give up smoking. 
 (United Press International, August 25, 2006)  In another study, healthy middle-aged snus users underwent ultrasound
 assessment of endothelial-dependent flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery. It was found that oral moist

Important research results on Swedish snus:<br>
<blockquote>It is unclear whether use of Swedish snus causes dental caries. <br>
&#8226;	Use of Swedish snus causes reversible inflammation in the gingival mucosa (gingivitis) in some individuals at the site<br>
 where the pinch is placed. There seems not to be any association between the use of snus and periodontitis (loosened teeth). 
&#8226;	Gingival recessions are more common in users of loose snus than in users of portion-packed snus and are irreversible. <br>
&#8226;	Snus use causes benign changes in the oral mucosa (snus dipperâ€™s lesions). These changes arise at the site where the 
pinch is placed. <br>
&#8226;	There is an association between the degree of oral mucosal lesion and consumption factors such as daily duration,
daily consumption and number of years. <br>
&#8226;	When snus users reduce their daily consumption or when users of loose snus switch to portion-packed snus the degree
 of oral mucosal lesions decrease both from a clinical and a histological perspective. <br>
&#8226;	The degree of oral mucosal lesion increases both with increasing pH and nicotine content. <br> 
&#8226;	Snus lesions are reversible, i.e. the oral mucosa reverses to normal condition after cessation of snus use. <br>
&#8226;	Users of portion-packed snus have less pronounced snus lesions than users of loose snus. <br> 
&#8226;	Epidemiological data do not indicate any association between snus use and serious dysplastic oral mucosal changes or
pre-carcinogenic effects in the oral cavity. These results agree well with the fact that no tumours or dysplasia have been
 found in the oral cavity among 500 snus users who have been examined annually for several years.<br>

 &#8220;that smokeless products are in fact a cause of oral cancer and pancreatic cancer in humans. The current evidence does not
 support smokeless tobacco as a substitute for cigarette smoking.&#8221; (Heart Center Online - Reuters)  </b></p><b> 
</b><p><b>Smokeless tobacco (snus and chewing tobacco) may be a risk factor for pancreatic cancer.  (part of the found at Gothiatek web 
site - Swedish Match). In a recently published prospective cohort study, comprising more than 10 000 Norwegian men, the 
relationship between the use of smokeless tobacco (snus and chewing tobacco) and the risk of cancer of pancreas and other 
organs, such as oral cavity/pharynx, esophagus, stomach, lung, kidney or bladder was studied. The authors found that snus 
use was associated with significant increase in the risk of pancreatic cancer. The increase in risk was only seen among 
ever-users of snus who were smokers at the start of the study, 40 years earlier. Snus use was, however, not associated with
 increases in risk of cancer of the oral cavity/pharynx, esophagus, stomach, lung, kidney or bladder (Boffetta et al., 2005).</b></p>
<b> 
</b><p><b>Even Chris Proctor, head of science and regulation for British American Tobacco stated that snus is less harmful but not
 harmless. &#8220;Smokers who switch should reduce their health risk, although the best way to avoid the risks is still not to
 consume tobacco at all.&#8221; </b></p><b> 
<h4><b><a name="Other"><u>Other Adverse Conditions</u></a></b></h4>
<br>
</b><p><b><u>Pregnancy</u> - the evidence regarding snuff use during pregnancy is limited. The results of one Swedish study showed an increased risk of
 preterm delivery and preeclampsia and probably also reduced fetal growth, in the offspring of mothers who used snuff during
 pregnancy . (2006 Tobaksfakta) Premature birth is now considered the leading cause of infant mortality in the
United States - more than a third of all infant deaths (William M. Callaghan et al., Pediatrics, October 2006). </b></p>
<p><b>Smokeless Tobacco Use <u>Increases Cataract Risk</u> - using snuff or chewing tobacco is associated with an increased likelihood
 of developing cataracts, Indian researchers report Dr. Prema Raju of the Vision Research Foundation, Sankar Netralaya,
Chennai and colleagues evaluated tobacco use among 3924 adults from rural areas. In all, 1705 used tobacco in various forms.
Nine hundred subjects, mainly women, used smokeless tobacco -- either as snuff or for chewing -- while 731 smoked tobacco 
predominantly in rolled cigarette-style bidis. The remainder used both forms. Overall, tobacco users had 72 percent higher
prevalence of cataracts, the team reports in the British Journal of Ophthalmology. 
However, the prevalence of cataracts was more than twice as great among those using the smokeless forms as compared to
 smokers. Also, cataracts affected nine times more heavy users of smokeless as compared to heavy smokers, the researchers report.
Dr. Raju mentioned that smokeless tobacco users have three-times higher levels of cadmium in their blood than 
non-users. Cadmium present in tobacco inactivates superoxide dismutase, an antioxidant, resulting in oxidant damage to the lens 
of the eye British Journal of Ophthalmology, online July 12, 2006.(Reuters Health News, 7/24/2006) </b></p>
<p><b><u>Metabolic Syndrome</u> - researchers from Umeå University in
 Sweden have discovered that consuming more than four cans of oral smokeless tobacco (snus) per week increases the risk 
of developing metabolic syndrome, which in turn can increase the risk of heart and circulatory disease and diabetes.
 This fact is demonstrated by the world’s most extensive long-term study on oral smokeless tobacco (snus) use. 
Margareta Norberg, a doctor in the Epidemiology and Public Health Studies Department at Umeå University and one of the
 researchers involved in the study, states: “Our results are a warning that show it is important to continue vigilance on 
the adverse health effects of snus.” The study is due to be published in the December 2006 issue of the Scandinavian 
Journal of Public Health (Globalink, Global Tobacco Control), European News Bulletin 176:18-24, August 2006).</b></p> 
<p><b><u>Delayed Wound Healing</u> - the association between cigarette smoking and delayed wound healing is well recognized
in clincal practice. This same adverse condition most likely occurs in users of smokeless tobacco. Potential mechanisms by which
tobacco use delays wound healing include: nicotine is a vasoconstrictor that reduces nutritional blood flow to the skin
resulting in  tissue ischemia also nicotine reduces the proliferation of red blood cells, fibroblasts and macropahges
(Smoking and wound healing, P Silverstein, Ann J Med 93(1A):225-245, 1992).
 In addition,
in orthopaedic conditions - several studies have shown that nicotine interferes with healing of bone fractures and also inhibits 
bone fusion processes --- many spine surgeons, e.g., won't do certain operations on people who smoke because of the risk of
failure. Nicotine has also  been found to effect tendon and ligament healing. Studying rotator cuff injury in rats, researchers
at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis found exposure to nicotine delays tendon-to-bone healing, suggesting 
this could cause failure of rotator cuff repair following surgery in human patients  
(Nicotine Delays Tendon-to-Bone Healing In A Rat Shoilder Model, L Galatz et al., Journal Bone Joint Surgery 88:2027-2034, 2006).

<p><b><u>Nicotine Promotes Growth Of Tumors Already Established By Tobacco Carcinogens</u>
While it is established that nicotine by itself is not carcinogenic, researchers have now shown that nicotine promotes 
cell proliferation and the progression of tumors already initiated by tobacco carcinogens. 
In a study by Srikumar Chellappan and colleagues from the University of South Florida appearing online on July 20 
in advance of print publication in the August (2006) issue of the Journal of Clinical Investigation, the authors show that the
 presence of receptors that bind nicotine, known as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), on bronchial cells as well
 as lung cancer cells are key to nicotine-induced cell proliferation of lung cancer cells. Also, Christopher Heeschen,

Nicotine: the Link Between Cigarette Smoking and Kidney Disease</a></u> A new study has demonstrated that human mesangial cells
 (cells in the blood vessels of the kidneys) are endowed with nicotinic receptors and may play an active role in the
 development of certain kidney diseases. Nicotine, at concentrations similar to those found in the plasma of smokers, 
promote mesangial cell proliferation and may accelerate and promote the progression of chronic kidney disease.  
(EA Jaimes, Run-Xia Tian and L Raij, Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol  292: H66-H75, 2007). </b></p>
<p>Nicotine: (from John Polito, Esq, Editor - Why Quit? - written communication 8/15/2007) There is growing concern that nicotine contributes to poor
 memory, a host of mental health disorders, destruction of brain
 gray matter, early dementia, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, stomach and duodenal ulcers, and macula degeneration 
that produces blindness? Is it true that nicotine accelerates tumor growth rates and reduces chemotherapy effectiveness? </p> 
<font size="3">Please remember that snus-like products contain relatively more nicotine than a tobacco cigarette.</font>

<h3><b><a name="Promotion"><u>Promotion of Moist Snuff - <font size="5">NO</font> - More Research/Regulations Needed</u></a></b></h3>
<p><b> Both the social and life scientist involved with tobacco
control (elimination) must come together to prevent the wide distribution of
smokeless, spitless tobacco products - SNUS. Dr. Gunilla Bolinder, director of education at 
Stockholm's Karolinska University Hospital points out, "To sing the praises of SNUS is a deathblow 
to 20 years of hard tobacco preventive work in Sweden. SNUS only saves the life of the tobacco industry"
(SNUS gets the thumbs-down NEWS-24 1/31/2007). </b></p>
<b><p>
In a cohort study it was found (after 20 years of follow-up) the risk of dying from major tobacco-related diseases
including lung cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke and COPD were higher among former cigarette
smokers who switched to spit tobacco after they stopped smoking than among those who quit using tobacco 
entirely. The cohort consisted of 116,395 men that were identified as switchers (n=4443) or cigarette smokers 
who quit using tobacco entirely (n=111,952) when enrolled in the ongoing ACS Cancer Prevention Study II.

<p><b>Smokeless tobacco use between 1986 and 2003 was low among adolescent girls and remained unchanged during the study period.
For 12th grade boys, it rose slightly from 1986 until the early 1990s. From the mid-1990s to 2003 smokeless tobacco 
use among 8th, 10th, and 12th grade boys dropped sharply.(Nelson, DE et al, Am J Public Health

<a href="#" onmouseover="doTooltip(event,9)" onmouseout="hideTip()">Richard H. Carmona, M.D., MPH, the 
17th  Surgeon  General</a> of the United States who
 resigned his post on July 31, 2006. Heâ€™ll never be forgotten for his bold statement on Tuesday, June 3, 2003 testifying 
before the Subcommittee on  Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection (Committee on Energy and Commerce, United States House
 of Representatives) at the hearing, &#8220;Can Tobacco Cure Smoking? A Review of Tobacco Harm Reduction" - <i>the Subcommitee was
addressing an effort by US Smokeless Tobacco Company (UST), to have their products recognized and marketed as less
harmful than cigarettes</i>. When  asked  by
 Rep. Ed Whitfield (R-Ky.), if he would support the &#8216;abolition of all tobacco productsâ€™ - Dr. Carmona  said, That he was 
"... not a legislator but that he would "support banning or abolishing tobacco products." 
He saw <a href="snus_banned_tobacco_cmt.html">"no need for any tobacco 
products in society."</a>
This was the first time the governmentâ€™s top doctor and public health
advocate has made such a strong statement. From this point on he was
kept on a tight leash by the administration thereafter. 
<a href="Carmano_SG_News_Observer_7_11_2007.jpg">(The News & Observer: Carmona says Bush officials muzzled him - 
July 11, 2007.)</a>
 Even though
frustrated by political pressure that favored tobacco interests he was
able to publish the 
<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/sgr_2006/index.htm">
Surgeon Generalâ€™s Report of 2006</a> - "Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke" - a comprehensive
science-based report that emphasized the dangers of second-hand smoke -
&#8220;involuntary smoking.&#8221; Dr.Carmona's blunt and extensively researched
report found that there is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand
smoke and said the only way to protect nonsmokers from the dangerous
chemicals in secondhand smoke is to eliminate smoking indoors. In his
opening remarks at the hearing Dr. Carmona started with a few
statements that were once accepted throughout society that have now
been relegated to the status of myth.<br>
<blockquote>Men do not suffer from depression. <br>
	Domestic violence is a 'family' or 'private' matter. <br>
	The HIV-AIDS epidemic is of no concern to most Americans. <br> <br>
All of us here know that these three statements are very dangerous public health myths.<br> <br> 
</blockquote>
My remarks today will focus on a <u>fourth public health myth</u> which could have severe consequences in our nation,
 <font size="4">especially among our youth: 
smokeless tobacco is a good alternative to smoking. It is a myth. It is not true.</font></b><p></p>
<p><b>In conclusion the Surgeon General stated that, &#8220;We simply do not have enough quality scientific evidence to 
conclude that any tobacco product, including smokeless tobacco, is a means of reducing the risks of cigarette smoking. 
At this time, any public health recommendation that positions smokeless tobacco as a safer substitute for cigarettes or
 as a quitting aid would be premature and dangerous. With the memory of our experience with 
<a href="Share__the__Blame.html">low-tar cigarettes</a> fresh in
 our minds, we must move extremely cautiously before making any statement or endorsement about the potential reduced risk 
of any tobacco product."</b></p>
<p><b>We are in agreement with Drs. Dorothy Hatsukami, Charlotte Lemmonds and Scott Tomar in that considerable more quality
research and product regulation is necessary prior to considering smokeless tobacco as a harm reduction method 
(Prev Med 38(3):309-317, 2004).</b></p>
