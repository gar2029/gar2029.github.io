As a starter - We applaud - <font size="4">Health Access California</font> - 
for getting
 <u>Proposition 79</u> on the ballot for November in California. 
People of California must get behind this proposition and make sure it
 succeeds.  <u>Proposition 79</u> will allow California
to negotiate for cheaper prescription drugs, similar to Canada and most 
other countries throughout the world.

Skyrocketing medical costs are affecting the hiring practices of employers.. 
<br> <br>
A Price Waterhouse Cooper Survey found that half of large U.S. companies  - 
say healthcare costs have cut profits over 
he past year. A quarter of these 
companies surveyed said cost increase might force them to cut employee
 pay increases 
and 1/5 said they might slow hiring of new employees because of higher health 
care cost. 
<br> <br> 
<font size="4" color="0000FF"><u>Proposition 79</u> - can reduce employer's 
health premiums by authorizing a new purchasing pool
 to reduce prices for 
employer-paid coverage.</font>
The United States spent more than twice per person what other countries
 spent on health care but were not the healthiest 
people in the world. Medical expenses were 47% higher per citizen than the
 next closes provider - Switzerland.  <br> <br>

Prescription drug costs are the fastest-growing portion of health-care spending
 nationwide, rising to 10.7% of health 
spending from 5.8% in 2003. The report by the Federal Government's Accountability Office found the price of 96 drugs
 used by older Americans rose 24.5% from January 2000 through December 2004. 
Twenty of the medications accounted for
 almost two-thirds of the increase. Pfizer's cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor
 and pain pill Celebrex led the increase 
in retail drug prices heavily used by older people, from 2000 to 2004, 
according to the government report.
<br> <br> 
<i>England spends far less than the United States on drugs, not only because of
usage restrictions but also because the government sets limits on the profits
drug companies are allowed to make. Even after adding out-of-pocket costs,
 England's per capita drug bill is less than half of that in the United States -
about $340 a year per English person versus about $800 per American.
 (The Wall Street Journal, 11/22/2005)</i>

More and more people have to decide to buy medication or put food on the table. The most vulnerable to the high cost of 
prescription drugs are the people with no medical insurance. The elderly on fixed incomes struggle to pay for life-saving
 prescription drugs that have risen in price by more than 15% a year - 5 times
 the rate of inflation for the past several
 years.. 29% of Americans failed to fill a prescription in 2000 because
 they could not afford it.  While families struggle 
to pay for medications - drug makers prosper. <br> <br>

Drug companies are laughing all the way to the bank..They know by spending millions on lobbyists - some former government
 employees of the same government agencies the drug companies want to influence - they're going to get their way.
<br> <br> 
Many blame the industry's clout in congress and with the executive branch
 for the high prices of drugs. (Global drug companies make the bulk of their
 profits in the US..) 
The pharmaceutical and health products industry has spent more than
 $800 million on federal lobbying and
campaign donations at the federal and state levels in the past 7 years(Center for
 Public Integrity). Its lobbying operation, on which it reports spending more 
than $675 million is the biggest in the nation.
<img src="lobbyist.jpg">
 No other industry has spent more money to sway public policy for that
 period of time.
 Of the 20 largest pharmaceutical
 corporations, 9 are based in the US. Yet drugs in the U.S. are more expensive
 than in any other part of the world.  
<br> <br>  
Back in 1998 we were some of the first concerned citizens along with
 U.S. Representative Tom Allen (District 1, Maine) 
about the <a href="sam2.html">high prices of prescription drugs especially for the elderly and the uninsured.</a> 
 We thought at this time the new senator elect from N.C., John Edwards - 
the so-called People's Senator, would work closely with Congressman Allen to 
help battle the pharmaceutical
companies influence and help pass the "Prescription Drug Fairness Act."
<br> <br>      
Importation of drugs from places like Canada is only a short term solution. 
<b>We need a permanent program of price controls like other 
developed countries. A bulk-buying program similar to that for Veterans
 may work and would then lower drug prices and save the states, consumers
 and employees 
hundreds of million dollars per year. At present a Veteran
 can get your prescription drug for about
 1/2 of what a typical uninsured American pays.  
<br><br>
If we start to <font size="4" color="0000FF">Take America Back</font>  - the 
people band together for a common cause we can still get our way no matter
 how 
much drug companies pay to convince the senators and congressman in their favor.
While must governments worldwide have regulated drug prices, the 
pharmaceutical industry has been able to block a host of 
measures aimed at controlling the process in the United States.

Widespread advertising of prescription drugs to consumers - FDA to re-evaluate
 direct-to-consumer drugs ad.. - in 1997 the
 FDA opened a Pandora's box when it changed the rules to permit widespread 
advertising of prescription drugs to consumers. 
 but health professionals. Last year, the pharmaceutical industry spent over
 $4 billion on TV and radio commercials, print
 ads and Web-based promotions to the public. But a chorus of criticism from 
Congress, physicians and the public has the 
FDA and the drug industry scrambling to re-evaluate this strategy. This year 
the AMA considered resolutions urging 
restrictions or even an outright ban on direct-to-consumer commercials.
A recent Kaiser Family Foundation study has found that for every dollar a
 pharmaceutical company invests in advertising to consumers, it 
rings up $4.20 in prescription drug sales.<br> <br>
The FDA will hold meetings (November 2-3, 2005)that could produce the first 
significant changes to drug advertising. <br> <br>

Except for New Zealand no other industrialized nation permits advertising of prescription medicines directly to consumers.

We know of at least one drug company that pays its executives large sums of money while charging their employees 
a monthly fee to use the wellness center on site.
<br> <br>
Did you ever wonder how drug store chains like Walgreen's, CVS and Eckerd's can afford to build all those beautiful 
drug stores springing up all over the country.  The pharmacist encourages you 
to buy the generic version of the medication
 prescribed - you think gee these are nice people they want to  
save me some
money. Don't be so na√Øve.
<br> <br> 
Paul Moriarty, a consumer specialist working for KYW-TV in Philadelphia did a comparison study of the cost one generic 
drug in various stores. He found that Enalapril, an antihypertensive agent, the generic version of Vasotec, selling for 
$60 at Walgreens and $68 at Eckerd Drugs, even though it costs them about $5, a 1,300 percent mark up. He, too, found 
Costco to be the cheapest with a cost for Enalapril, for example, of $12.97.
He also found lower prices at Wal-Mart and K-Mart, but not as low as Costco. I just had a prescription filled for 
penicillin because of an abscessed tooth and the pharmacy technician told me that CVS charges a "filling fee" to 
help pay for the pharmacist's time, the technician and also the paper work that has to be done to fill the prescription.
