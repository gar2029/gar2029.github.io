<p>Teen Unhealthy Behaviors - take Tobacco Abuse.  For more than 30 years, researchers and tobacco control experts have 
attempted to find a solution to the problem of underage smoking. Billions of dollars have been spent. Countless studies
 and surveys have been conducted. Numerous programs and approaches have been tried, from school-based anti-tobacco education 
programs to the banning of tobacco advertising. All apparently to no avail, because today's youth smoking rates are 
as high as they were 20 years ago.</p>
<p>From 1999 National Youth Tobacco Survey found with middle school students 
12.8% and of high school students 34.8%
 who used some form of tobacco {cigarettes, smokeless tobacco products, 
cigars, pipes, bidis (thin unfiltered flavored cigarettes or
 kreteks (clove cigarettes)}. 
 Let's face it - kids these days have a hard time growing up under this influence. Making the move to adulthood 
even more complex are the possibility of family problems, poverty and illness.</p>
<p>The solution to avoiding teen unhealthy behavior (tobacco use, alcohol use, use of other abused drugs) starts with a
 strong community support system for each and every youngster that will be there in the good times and help them get
 through the rough times. The support system (guidance, reinforcement) consists of a combination of parents, grandparents,
 educators, religious groups, siblings and close friends serving as role models - total community involvement.
  The goals are to both teach right and wrong by example and have the youngsters feel good about themselves. When 
children feel valued, have self-esteem and have a positive attitude they are more likely to develop healthy skills,
 avoid risky behavior and remain in school.</p>

<p>We'll all agree that the kids in our communities have plenty of outside pressures to lead them down the wrong trail. 
School performance is a critical point where some of our youngsters can start to have problems. There are sort of two 
groups: one group is of the  students doing well in school, that gets the most attention from educators and can look
 forward to attending college and having a bright future. The second group has a much more difficult time. Peer pressure
 is important here - the kids in the first group all of sudden no longer want to bother with kids who fall into Group #2. 
 School is not going well and group #2 students may have difficulty relating to peers or even may have problems at home. 
These kids naturally want to fit in, to belong, and get the feeling sometimes of "why even try," and start to look for
 alternatives that can lead to unhealthy behaviors. Wanting to be accepted, they start searching out fellow students 
with similar problems. Others may be already engaging in unhealthy behaviors--they find it "cool" to take unhealthy 
risks and jeopardize their future.</p>
<p>We can't let this happen because these kids ARE our future. Continuous on-going support to convince each student he/she 
can be successful, has to be in place; we need to convince the students in Group #2 that everyone can be successful and
 have a positive future with effort. A program needs to be in-place that helps students determine their interests and 
capabilities, that they are capable of pursuing these interests and that their pursuits would lead to good availability
 of jobs. We need to provide direction and continuous encouragement to convince the children to believe in themselves; 
to help the students succeed and create a path for them to accomplish their goals.</p>
<p>Job availability - for a community support
 program to be successful there must be the availability of jobs
 for these kids. It is impossible to stop abusive behavior 
if we can't guarantee a positive future with a little bit of effort on the
 part the teenager. Recently a spokesman for the African American 
community indicated that 40% of black males between the ages of 16 and 
65 are unemployed. Another obstacle: <i>Smokers Need Not Apply!!</i> - this
 message has begun to appear more and more on job descripions.</p>
<p>We all want our youngsters to become happy, successful productive members of our communities. Let's get started helping
 these kids through their difficult years.</p>
<p>We must realize that some of the most successful people were late 
bloomers or slow achievers who never gave up-we must
 find the reason why they did not give up.</p>
