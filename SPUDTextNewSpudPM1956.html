<p><font size="+2">A frank confession</font> about <u>old</u> Spud Cigarettes (1956<font face="Times New Roman">)</font></p>
<p> (Not to be mistaken with the Tobacco Industry Research Council's "A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers" released January 4, 1954) </p>
<br wp="BR1"><p><font face="Times New Roman">The old Spud was the first mentholated cigarette. Its sales sky-rocketed in the early thirties,
making the old Spud one of America's leading brands.</font></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">But the old Spud was in serious trouble when it was bought from the original makers by Philip
Morris. Its reputation was gone. Its sales were shrinking.  </font></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><font size="+1">The failure of the old Spud</font></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><font face="Times New Roman"></font><font face="Times New Roman">Here's what had happened: Spud's previous owners had allowed the old Spud to ride on its
reputation too long. No efforts were made to improve the old Spud cigarette itself. And new
cigarettes had entered the mentholated field - at cut prices. The makers of the old Spud refused
to lower prices to meet this competition.</font></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">As a result, the old Spud sat on shelves too long and was often stale when it reached a smoker's
lips. On taking over Spud, Philip Morris was determined to make drastic changes. </font></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+1"><strong>Plans for a new cigarette</strong></font></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><font face="Times New Roman"></font><font face="Times New Roman">Plans were drawn up to repair the errors of the past. But we wanted to go further than a mere
repair job. Our aim was to make a completely different cigarette. </font></p>
<br wp="BR1"><font face="Times New Roman">    Years of research were devoted to this job.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">           First, we decided to develop a new blend of tobaccos and to use the very best money can
          buy. Tobacco is the heart of a great cigarette.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">        </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">           Next, we decided to add a <u>filter</u>. So our research laboratory was asked to develop a filter
           which would remove impurities from the smoke - but also let the flavor of our rich
           tobaccos come through.</font></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">     More than a hundred filters were tested - and  rejected. Then, early in 1956, we got it - a filter
     which is not only efficient, but aslo free-breathing:</font></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><font size="+1">How much menthol ?</font></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><font face="Times New Roman"></font><font face="Times New Roman">Stage three was our menthol research program. Just how much menthol do people want in a
cigarette?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">    Our purpose was to create a cigarette which would appeal to smokers not only when they have
a cold, but all the time. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">    We discovered a starling fact. We had been putting too much menthol in the old Spud. It
tasted so "medicated" that people smoked only when they were sick.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">    We found that what smokers really wanted was just a hint of menthol, a light touch.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">         We discovered that this light touch of menthol freshens the smoke. And it acts on the
tobacco the way salt acts on steak . It accents the flavor. </font></p>
<br wp="BR1"><br wp="BR2">
<p><font size="+1">Triumph of New Filter Spud</font><font face="Times New Roman"></font></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">That is the story of Spud. The bitter failure of the old Spud, followed by long years of research,
culminating in the brilliant New Spud. A triumphant success.</font></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">    We put our great new cigarette in the package that's revolutionizing the tobacco industry - the
famous flip-top box. You'll approve of its red, white and blue-green design. </font></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">    Buy a pack of New Filter Spuds. If you don't agree that New Filter Spud is a finer cigarette
than the one you're now smoking, your money will be refunded by Philip Morris Inc., 100 Park
Avenue, New York 17, N.Y.</font></p>
