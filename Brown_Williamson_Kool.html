<blockquote> <b>
In order to survive, tobacco manufacturers need to continue to recruit
new cigarette smokers. The Master Settlement Agreement (MSA)created a 
$246 billion financial burden on the major tobacco companies forcing 
them to almost immediately to raise prices. To the surprise of most
observers, discount cigarette makers swarmed into the market selling 
cigarettes at or below prices available before the settlement. Older
established smokers quickly gave up their loyality to their special brands 
for the cheaper discount brands. Others smokers were quitting as a result
of developing a life-threatening tobacco-attributable chronic disease
or had died a premature death as a result of a tobacco smoking. It has 
been established that the majority of new cigarette smokers start smoking
before the age of 18. But the MSA forbade tobacco manufacturers from 
directly or indirectly  targeting youth in their promotional practices. 
We investigate the approach that Brown & Williamson took with 
their primary money maker - Kool to make sure the company would survive. 
The reader should read the information presented and decide for himself or
herself as to whether or not cigarette makers are targeting our 
<u>Future - the Youth of America.</u>

<p><u><b>Advertising - Impossible to Limit Exposure</b></u><br>
It's a known fact cigarette advertising and promotional items do appear to play a role in an adolescent's or 
teenager's decision to begin smoking (JAMA 279: 516-520, 511-515, 1998).
</p><br>
<p>Tobacco companies keep on insisting that they are not targeting youngsters 
(those younger than 18 or 19 (in some states))
 to smoke and it hard to demonstrate intent on the part of cigarettes 
manufacturers.  Trends in smoking among young
 people follow those of adults. Boys see men smoking and want to do the
 same-- and the same can be seen with girls and
 women smokers. Cigarette advertising links smoking with being "cool", 
taking risks and growing up (http://www.infact.org/youth.html). </p>
<p>The Master Settlement Agreement (MSA - November 1998 - to recover
 tobacco-related health care costs)
with the tobacco 
industry  appears to have had little effect
 on cigarette advertising in magazines and on the exposure of young people
 to these advertisements (King and Siegel, 
NEJM 345(7): 504-511, 2001). The primary focus of MSA was for prohibiting
 youth-targeting in advertising, marketing 
and promotions--commitment to reducing youth access and consumption.   
(Not to take any action, directly or indirectly,
 but to prevent targeting youth in tobacco company advertising or marketing;
 still tobacco companies are finding ways to reach kids with a message to smoke.</p>
<p> The agreement prohibits tobacco advertising that targets people younger
 than 18 years of age.  According to the FDA a magazine is youth
 oriented if more than 15% of the readers were between 12 to 17 
years old or more than two million of their
 readers were 12 to 17 years old (Fed Register Aug 28, 1996 44446-44496).
Cigarette advertising expenditures in magazines with more than 15% 
youth readership increased $30 million after the MSA (Cigarette Advertising
Expenditures Before and After the Master Settlement Agreement: 
Preliminary Findings, Turner-Bowker and Hamilton, May 15, 2000).  </p>
<p>It is true that by seemingly targeting adults (especially young adults 18 to 24 years) tobacco companies know that kids
 will get the message that it is cool and sophisticated to smoke.  The tobacco companies continue to try to hook new 
generations of customers on their tobacco products because they need to do that for the very survival of their industry
 (Dr. Dileep Bal, President of the American Cancer Society).</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the activities of Brown and Williamson in promoting their key money maker - Kool - after the
 signing of the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) of November 23, 1989 
between the Attorneys General  of 46 states (and five U.S. territories)
 and the major tobacco companies. (Four states (Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi 
and Texas) had previously settled with tobacco manufacturers for $40 
billion.)</p> 
<p><u><b>The Need to Encourage Young People to Smoke</b></u><br>
The Master Settlement Agreement (MSA - November 1998) put a heavy burden on large tobacco companies.  The states and public
 health advocates expected the sheer size of the settlement--a combined $246 billion over 25 years--to discourage 
smoking by forcing large tobacco companies to raise prices. It was not anticipated that in response to the settlement 
upstart discount cigarette makers swarmed into the market selling cigarettes at or below prices available before the 
settlement.</p>
<p>Brown & Williamson fared the worst among the major tobacco companies.  It's sales in the fourth quarter of 2000 were 35% 
lower than the 3rd quarter of 1998, just before the settlement was signed.  The main reason for this downward trend was
 because the smokers of Brown & Williamson brands Kool, Lucky Strike, Viceroy, GPC and Carlton tend to be older and more 
likely to quit (or die from a tobacco attributable disease?) or trade down to cheaper cigarettes.  The young smoker base
 had all but disappeared. "We've really been hit ,"  said Susan Ivey, the then Chairman and CEO of Brown & Williamson.
 "We've certainly had consumers trade down to those lower-priced options." (Mrs. Ivey assumed this position January 2001
 after returning from working at BAT (British American Tobacco)--the former parent of  Brown & Williamson--to return to 
Louisville to be Senior VP for Marketing in the middle of 1999.)</p>
<p>Ivey was tapped to help the company recover. She was considered the savior to stop the steady decline in cigarette sales. 
People felt Ivey could breath a renewed outlook into a business that was faltering. </p>
<p>The company tried to counteract the bad years by streamlining operations becoming lean and mean and more effective. Ivey 
indicated that we faced a decline in market share and profitability and we were forced to take a close look at who we were,
 how we got where we were and where we were going.</p>
<p>The focus was on rebuilding its key brands especially Kool which is the largest contributor to company revenue, volume and
 profits. Because of that, the company couldn't stand by and watch as market share continued to deteriorate said Mrs. Ivey.
</p>
<p>Part of the strategy was to see how Brown  & Williamson could enhance the Kool brand to smokers ages 21 and 30 The Kool
 brand had lost leadership in the menthol category, since  primarily it has been unable to attract customers in their
 20s and 30s while many of its faithful older buyers are no longer around. B&W; needed a plan for Kool again to appeal
 to younger adult smokers who tend to be most loyal and least sensitive to rising prices of smokes.</p>
<p>They needed to come up with a strategy that was capable of turning things around, but caution had to be exercised
because B&W; wanted to be a responsible commercial organization. Yet their profitability depended on the sales of
 cigarettes to young adult smoker. </p>
<p>(Brown & Williamson does provide funding for the development and implementation of programs aimed at reducing young 
people's motivation to smoke. Currently the company supports the youth smoking prevention activities of some 15 community 
organizations. It has been found that tobacco industry youth programs do
more harm than good for tobacco control (Landman et al., Am J Pub Health
92(6): 917-930, 2002).</p>
<p>So, the purpose of our marketing activities appears to persuade existing adult smokers to smoke the Kool brand. But
 it is obvious by implementing campaigns to regain market share with young adult smokers, they are influencing youngster
 to smoke. </p>
<p>
Mrs. Ivey commented on the marketing strategy to regain market share for Kool - "It's a guerilla 
warfare approach." When Senior Vice President for Marketing (Monday, July 23, 2000.). <br> <br>

 <br> <br> 
"Kool has been around for a very long time,"  reasoned Mrs. Ivey when Senior VP for Marketing. "It has a 
fantastic heritage and pedigree, but it has an old profile and peaked in the '70s. " "The 'B Kool' Campaign did 
provide us approved perceptions about being more contemporary, but it did not stake out Kool's menthol authority. 
We wanted to communicate a product superiority message."<br> <br><br> <br>

<img src="B_Kool1_1999.gif" width="100" length="70" align="left" border="0">
</a>  <br> <br> 
The message with the 'B Kool' Campaign, that lasted about two years, seemed to be that the woman has her eyes on the guy
 with Kool cigarettes. This campaign suggested Kool was more contemporary and relevant than the smokers may have thought.
 They wanted to more clearly communicate a product superiority message. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 
<a href="Kool_HouseOfMenthol.jpg">
<img align="left" src="Kool_HouseOfMenthol.jpg" width="100" length="200"></a>
 <br><br>
The theme 'We Built the House of  Menthol' was born intended to remind smokers that Kool initiated the menthol category
 way back in 1933 and was just about the only significant menthol until
 RJ Reynolds' Salem in 1956.  
<a href="SPUD1.html">This is not entirely
 true - the house of menthol was  built by Lloyd 'Spud' Hughes  of 
 Mingo Junction, Ohio - the inventor of first menthol
 cigarette  called Spud.</a>   As for the echoes in the new theme of the House of Blues, the music 
club chain, and the popular song by Jefferson Starship "We Built This City," Ivey said.  "Kool had a very long
 association with the annual jazz festival  And we're active in local markets, in bars and nightclubs, with trial
 and promotional vehicles like the Kool Mix Programme." <br> <br> 
<a href="Kool_WeBuiltTheHouseOfMentho2.jpg">
<img align="left" src="Kool_WeBuiltTheHouseOfMentho2.jpg" width="100" length="200"></a> <br> <br> 
When Richard Newman of Bates USA--the advertising agency--asked smokers , "What does it say to you about a brand 
that claims to be 'The House of Menthol' we got a lot of positive feedback that it was a claim of ownership and 
rightful heritage." Newman said "  The ads also used words and phrases like "Authentic,", "King of all menthols" and 
"The Menthol movement."<br> <br><br> <br>
<a href="#">
</a> <br> <br>
<br>
The strategy included a new packaging for Kool cigarettes in solid light green, dark green and blue
 colors--
 packaging design supported by the new advertising campaign Kool's 
'House of Menthol' slogan. 
<a href="#">
</a>
Brown & Williamson 
test market Kool's new look in its best market, Hawaii, where it had 17% market share. Consumers viewed the new package
 as "high energy, up to date and high quality.</p>
<p>Ludo Cremers , Brown &Williamson;'s divisional VP  brand  marketing, indicated that although demographics show that Kool
 smokers are a diverse group - 50% Caucasian, 40% African American, 10% Hispanic - the advertising will be aimed at a 
hip, urban audience. </p>
<p>Ivey's strategy seemed to be working, the slide of  Kool was stabilized
 and the Kool brand family actually  increased to 
2.95% in 2003 from 2.88%  in 2002. (R. Covino, The Brawny Brands, 
 Tobacco Outlet Business July/August 7(4): 2004). With
 this good news the decision must have been made to heighten the marketing effort regardless of the consequences to
 attract young smokers and convince them it's "Time to step into the house" 
 - The House of Menthol.</p>

Kool MIXX Program - 2004 was the 6th year of this  hip-hop disc jockey competition held in 13 cities in the
 United States. Cities included were
 Detroit, MI, St. Louis, MO, Cleveland, OH, Atlanta, GA, New Orleans, LA, Houston, TX, Philadelphia, PA, Brooklyn, NY,
 Manhattan, NY, Miami, FL, Los Angeles, CA, San Francisco, CA, 
Washington, D.C. and Chicago where the semi-finals and 
finals were held.   Chosen were the largest urban area in the country where Brown & Williamson believed it can get the
 greatest return from sponsorship. William Robinson, who chairs the National African American Tobacco Prevention Network,
 has stated that these advertising campaigns are almost impossible to escape in areas with large minority populations. 
Also for the first time Kool cigarettes came out with a package featuring images of brown-skinned people. Brown and 
Williamson conceded that the special edition boxes of Kool were a mistake 
and discontinued them (Chicago Sun Times, 
suntimes.com, Cheryl V. Jackson, staff reporter). <br> <br> 
<p>The material was promoted widely and included an emcee competition where poets in hip-hop rap about history,
 culture and politics to a rhythm and beat.

<p><b>Smooth  Fusions</b> -in March (3/19/04) straight from the House of Menthol, Kool introduced the Smooth Fusion Promotion, 
four new menthol 
experiences that fused the legendary smoothness of Kool with unexpected flavors and a revolutionary pack design. 
According to Ludo Cremers , Brown & Williamson's divisional VP  brand 
 marketing, "Kool established the menthol category
 and continues to reinvent it to give consumers a product that fits the
 lifestyle of today's urban, multicultural smokers. 
 The new Kool Smooth Fusions cigarettes are perfectly balanced, yet deliver
 intriguing refreshment with a taste that bonds
 with any special occasion."  </p>
<a href="Kool_Ad_EntertainmentWeekly_two_6_25_7_2_2004.jpg">
<img align="left" src="Kool_Ad_EntertainmentWeekly_two_6_25_7_2_2004.jpg" width="100" length="200"></a>
<p>The four Kool Smooth Fusions are Caribbean Chill, Midnight Berry, Mocha Taboo and Minitrigue.   According to Cremers,
 "Each style evidences Kool expertise in  menthol and its ability to masterfully craft perfectly balanced, unique and 
distinct menthol experiences.  The Smooth Fusions styles each provide a truly extraordinary and innovative menthol
 smoking experience demanded by the leading edge lifestyle of today's menthol smoker." Again, tobacco makers claim those
 flavors are aimed at adults who like flavors. Their research tells them that adults
 have gone to flavors
as part of a market trend, e.g., you have lemon and cherry vodka. Maybe Brown &  Williamson with Kool are using flavored 
cigarettes to draw children  who are not used to the taste
 (more difficult taste to adjust to) of regular cigarettes.
  Sherri Watson Hyde, executive director of the National African American 
Tobacco Prevention Network,  has stated that 
the names of these cigarettes sound like funky juices or coffee drinks
 using these flavors to lure youngsters into a
 lifetime of smoking.</p>

<br><br>
Along with the new menthol smoking experiences, the Kool Smooth Fusions
 products also unveiled revolutionary new pack 
design. The pack has two rounded front corners and hinges open, offering
 13-cigarettes on one side and seven on the other.
  "This pack design is at the leading edge in cigarette packaging ," 
Cremers said. ":It gives Kool Smooth Fusions an
 identity like no other cigarette in the U.S. Market." 
<a href="#">
</a>
 The new flavored menthol cigarettes was a response to the demand
 for hip trendsetting consumers, Kool Smooth Fusion packs will be introduced in bar, restaurant and night time venues,
 making it available to the most up-to-date, plugged in smokers. Further expansion is planned later in the year.,  
 Ads placed in magazines... "Adult smokers who participated in our consumer
 research told us that these new flavors
 and the new pack design are 'something for me' and  'this is a pack to 
be seen with'," Cremers said. Kool Smooth Fusions
 are designed to attract adult smokers of competitive menthol cigarettes 
to Kool but in doing so they are influencing 
our youth to try smoking.</p>
<p> According to Ludo Cremers, divisional vice president, "Kool is truly on 
the cutting edge of menthol technology. 
Kool established the menthol category and continues to reinvent it 
to give consumers a product that fits the lifestyle
 of today's urban, multicultural smokers." (R. Covino, The Brawny Brands, Tobaco Outlet Business 
July/August 7(4): 2004).

<p>
Salem - a menthol cigarette that was never very appealing to young smokers had
 to also change its image
 in order prevent further erosion of market share. The re-launch of Salem
 began in early 2003 and it was felt
 the <b>"Stir the Senses"</b> campaign established a unqiue and relevant positioning. Salem markets two unique tastes:
Salem Green Label, with a lighter menthol taste and Salem Black Label, 
with a richer menthol-and-tobacco taste. Also - there's a limited distribution
Silver Label available in Cool Myst, Fire & Ice, Dark Currents and Deep Freeze.  
There's also a "Stir the Senses" tour visiting approximately 15 cities.</p>

<p><b><u>What has to be Done</b></u><br>
The main goal of cigarette ads is obviously to get young smokers
 to smoke but often turns out that young people
 are the target audience. Despite publicly agreeing not to advertise
 to youth, it seems like tobacco companies 
in order to survive can't stop looking for young new customers.
 Just when you think you have them down - like
the downward decline of Brown & Williamson after the MSA - a new scheme to
 get things in the black is unveiled.</p>
<p>
Susan Ivey the new President and CEO of Reynolds American, Inc. probably got this position because her strategy turned 
around the steady decline of Brown & Williamson. </p>
<p>
But at what expense did this occur. We're sure Mrs. Ivey would be the first to tell you their advertisements are not
 intended to target youths. But as Dr. Siegel points out, "from a public 
health perspective, which matters is whether
 adolescents are exposed to cigarette advertising that leads to begin 
smoking, whether that exposure was intentional 
or not."  Black youths are more likely than white youths to be exposed to 
magazine advertising by cigarette brands popular among black adolescents
(King et al., Tob Control 9(1):64-70, 2000). </p>
<p>
More than 80% of adult smokers started before they turned 18 and by that time more than half of them were already smoking 
daily. Tobacco companies need some indirect way to get the word out to youngsters.  Kool promotions try to entice the
 potential Kool smoker inviting them to the House of Menthol, a place of "alluring" and "tantalizing" Smooth Fusion
 flavors. </p>
<p>
Young people, easily swayed, vastly underestimate the addictiveness of 
nicotine and think they won't be smoking in
 5-years - nearly 75% are still smoking 5 to 6 yrs later. 75% of
 adolescent smokers wish they had never started in the
 first place. The tobacco industry has exploited the fact that adolescents
are not in a position to make an informed and rational choice about smoking
(Cummings et al., Tob Control 11: i5-i17, 2002).</p>
<p>
According to the Health & Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson smoking represents one of the greatest challenges to
 health, both in the United States and worldwide. African Americans continue to suffer disproportionately from chronic
 and preventable disease compared with white Americans (SG Report 1998).
 Approximately 3 of every 4 African Americans smokers 
prefer
 mentholated cigarettes - this is even higher for teens. 
The former Surgeon General David Satcher said, "The advertising campaigns 
luring minorities to smoke masks a more 
sinister reality: CDC statistics show 45,000 blacks die of smoking-related illnesses every year...African-Americans
 bear the greatest burden of cigarette smoking...And menthols may be starter 
cigarettes because of the
 minty flavor and the throat-warming effect."   </p>
<p>Once and for all, we have to eliminate this continued scheming by tobacco 
companies.
 Let's eliminate all tobacco product advertising except in locations
 where only adults frequent. Even in these 
locations the advertising should face inside and not outside where 
passers by can view. 
<a href="Tobacco_Ads_Mouth_Cancer.html">We must also keep in mind the 
advertisements for smokeless tobacco.</a></p>
<h3 align="center">-- Take the Teen out of Nicotine --</h3>
<p>The American Legacy Foundation (created as a result of the MSA) whose 
purpose is to combat tobacco use in the United States especially among 
the youth of America. Legacy funded in April 2004 the creation of the
 "African American Partners for a Tobacco Free Society." One of the first 
priorities for this group should be to apply pressure to the
publishers of black oriented magazines (e.g. <u>Essence</u>, <u>Ebony</u>)
 not to accept advertisements from tobacco companies. </p>
<p>
Brown & Williamson is facing litigation from more than two dozen states 
 which claims the company is marketing Kool 
cigarettes to youth.</p>
<p>
It will be interesting to see the marketing strategy, to be announced around 
the first of the year, that will be followed
 now that both Salem and Kool are marketed by the same company. 
Hopefully they'll change their various promotions 
to truly target adult smokers. </p>
<p>
But again - this just can't happen - in order to survive tobacco companies
 have to constantly seek out new
smokers. Even though there's a very strong likelihood tobacco use can lead
 to long drawn out suffering and 
eventual premature death.</p>
