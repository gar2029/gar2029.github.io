<h2>Menthol - Its Chemistry and Many Uses....</h3>
 <h5> draft - work continues on refining this document.. </h5>
<h3>
Menthol (also called Peppermint Camphor or Mint Camphor) is obtained from oil of peppermint
(species Mentha piperita) or Japanese or Chinese (also called cornmint) oil of peppermint
 (species Mentha arvensis) (Brown, 1995).   </h3><p>

<p>
Menthol is the chief constituent of peppermint oil and is responsible for its odor and
 taste and the "cooling sensation" when applied to the skin and mucosal surfaces.
Mentha piperita contains up to 50% menthol and Mentha arvensis contains 70-80% menthol
(Siegel-Maier, 1998) . <p>
<p>
Peppermint oil is one of the essential oils. These volatile oils are obtained by distilling
the flowers, leaves,  and roots of many plants with water, the oil separates from
the distillate and usually has an odor highly characteristic of the plant of origin.
The resulting oil mixture of organic compounds was thought to be the essence
(the most important ingredients) of the plant hence the word essential oils
(Streitwieser et al., 1992).<p>
<p>
Terpenes are a class of organic compounds that are most abundant component of essential oils
 of many plants and animals. Essential oils in particular oil of turpentine were known to
the ancient Egyptians. It was not until the 19th century that an effort was made to
determine the chemical
constituents of  essential oil. In 1818, the carbon to hydrogen ratio in oil of turpentine
 was found to be 5:8. This same ratio was subsequently found for a wide variety  of natural
 products. The collection of related material became known as terpenes - older spelling
for turpentine.  The
similarity in the atomic composition of the many terpenes led to the idea that they
might possess some unifying structural element (Loudon, 1983). <p>
<p>
In 1887, Otto Wallach, a German chemist, pointed out the common structural feature of the
 terpenes. They all consist of repeating units that have the same carbon skeleton,
as the 5-carbon isoprene structure. All terpenes could be generally dissected into more
 than one isoprene unit (Allinger et al., 1976).<p>
<p>
Because of the relationship to isoprene - terpenes are also called isoprenoids. Isoprenoids
are further classified by the number of carbons in their carbon chains. Those with 10 carbon
 atoms
are considered monoterpenes - menthol (2-isopropyl-5-methyl-cyclohexanol) is a cyclic monoterpene (Loudon, 1983). <p>

<p>
Menthol has three asymmetric carbon atoms in its cyclohexane ring and therefore occurs
as four pairs of optical isomers. The l-menthol is the isomer that occurs most widely
in nature and is the one assumed by the name menthol. This isomer has the characteristic
 peppermint odor and exerts a cooling sensation when applied to skin and mucosal surfaces.
The other isomers have a similar but not identical odor and do not have the same cooling
 action as l-menthol (Eccles, 1994).<p>
<p>
<p>
The most important determination to be made in examining the isolated peppermint oil
  is that of the total amount of menthol isolated. values for per cent menthol for
 Mentha piperita versus Mentha arvensis. The cost of menthol extracted from a plant's own
oils is much higher than menthol synthnesized from petroleum products.  75% of the world's
supply of peppermint comes from the United States with Oregon being the leading
mint producer..  As of 1996, 31,000 acres of peppermint were growing in the United States;
3,007,000 pounds were harvested at a total value of $35,783,000 (Washington Annual Bulletin,
 1997).<p>
<p>
<p>
Analytical Characteristics of L-Menthol <p>
On the cooling of peppermint oil to low temperatures the separation of menthol occurs especially
if a few crystals of menthol are added to start crystallization. The United States
Pharmacopeia describes menthol as forming colorless, prismatic crystals that have a strong
and pure odor of peppermint and a warm aromatic taste followed by the sensation of cold when air
is drawn into the mouth.

<p>
The volatility of menthol is the reason why it was so difficult to control the
concentration of menthol in cigarettes. Liggett and Meyers had a brand of cigarettes called
 "10 by 10"
- the pack had half menthol and half non-menthol in the same package. The arrangement
didn't work out - the menthol moved or equilibrated making all the cigarettes taste the same
(Philip Morris document number 2055557893).

<h4> Some other uses of menthol: </h4>
. as flavoring in the Nicorette inhaler with 10mg nicotine. <br>
. as a pesticide in controlling tracheal mite infestations in
honey bee colonies (Duff and Furgala, 1991). <br>
. used to ease the pain associated with a toothache or bee sting (Lewis, 1998). <br>
. the Oregon Mint Snuff Company sells dried mint leaves to use in place of
 chewing tobacco  <br> claimed to be a safe alternative to smokeless
tobacco (Corliss, 1998). <br>
. peppermint oil is used to relieve headaches - in 1996 a double-blind
 study of the effects of this<br> essential oil was conducted
and found
that an ethanol solution with 10 per cent peppermint was <br>as effective
 in relieving headaches as 1000 mg of acetaminophen
(Siegel-Maier, 1998).   <br> <br> <br>
