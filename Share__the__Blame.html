<h3>Share the Blame – Tobacco Companies and Tobacco Control</h3>
</center>
<p>
Evidence is presented that Tobacco Control scientists believed a safe cigarette could be produced
 and based on this assurance tobacco companies started to produce cigarettes that would deliver 
lower nicotine and tar in each puff of a cigarette.
</p>
<p>
The initial impetus for the development of new types of cigarettes can be traced back to the 
landmark articles by Doll and Hill in the United Kingdom (Smoking and carcinoma of the lung: 
preliminary report Br Med J II:739-48, 1950) and by Wynder and Graham in the United States in 
1950 (Tobaco smoking as a possible etiologic factor in bronchiogenic carcinoma, JAMA 143:329-36, 1950.
 Both studies indicated a dose-response relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked and the
 risk for lung cancer. These observations were supported by bioassays that demonstrated dose responses 
between the amount of “tar” applied to mouse skin and the incidence rates of skin tumors and between 
the exposure to whole cigarette smoke and the occurrence of tumors in the upper respiratory tract of
 hamsters. (Wynder EL, Graham EA, Croninger AB. Experimental production of carcinoma with cigarettes
 tar Cancer Res 13:855-64, 1953; Wynder EL, Kopf P, Ziegler H A study of tobacco carcinogenesis II 
Dose-response studies  Cancer 10:1193-2000, 1957; Dontenwill, Chevalier HJ, Harke HP, Lafrenz U, 
Reckzeh G, Schneider B Investigations on the effects of chronic cigarette smoke inhalation in
 Syrian golden hamsters JNCI 51: 1781-832, 1973).  
</p>
<p>
As a result, emphasis was placed on reducing the smoke yields of cigarettes.
</p>
<p>
The Readers Digest 1957 (the 2nd of 2-articles – Lois Mattox Miller and James Monahan) – effective 
filtration would remove from the smoke enough of these particles to reduce the health risk to a minimum 
while passing along to the smoker enough of them to produce flavorsome smoke. Where to draw the line 
is still uncertain. But Dr. Ernest L. Wynder of the Sloan-Kettering Institute states that, for 
practical purposes, a filter-tip capable of filtering out 40% of the tar would be a step in the right
 direction. (Assuming, of course, that the manufacturer does not defeat the purpose by loading the 
cigarette with stronger tobacco.) “Such a filter tip,” Dr. Wynder says, “placed on a regular-size
 cigarette
which normally  yields 30 milligrams of tar in its smoke; would reduce the smoker’s tar exposure to 
about 18 milligrams. A reduction to that level, as shown by animal studies and human statistical studies,
 would be a significant reduction in cancer risk.”
</p>
<p>
Further comment by Dr. Wynder – the filter tip cigarette has been the salvation of the tobacco industry.
 The greater the reduction in the smoke the greater the reduction in the risk of lung cancer.    
</p>
<p>
On June 4, 1957 – the final report on the American Cancer Society’s 44-month study of the smoking habits
 of 188,000 men 50 to 70 years old presented evidence of what the AMA called a “spectacular relationship”
 between cigarette smoking and lung cancer. But the report also showed that death rates from all causes combined rise with the number if cigarettes 
smoked daily.
</p>
<p>
Business Week Dec 16, 1967 – The government is interested in promoting cigarettes with low tar and 
nicotine content on the theory that they aren’t quite as bad for you. Says James C. Bowling, a 
vice-president of Philip Morris Inc.: “Although we maintain that low numbers are not proven meaningful,
 we will make cigarettes that way if that’s what smokers want.” 
</p>
<p>
Have we forgotten the outcome from the Task Force – The Less Hazardous Cigarette Working Group embarked 
on a 10 year government study (starting in 1969) to find a cigarette for those unwilling to quit that would 
reduce the risk of dying . The only tangible result of the committee’s work was a theory by Dr. Gio Gori 
Batta that a “socially tolerable” smoking limit was possible. As early as 1971, he cited epidemiological 
studies that he said showed low-tar cigarettes were less harmful than regular cigarettes.  He even went 
as far as to suggest a legal tar limit of 20 mg of tar and 1mg of nicotine.  He published his theory in 
Science in December,1976 and in JAMA in September,1978 in which he advocated “tolerable levels in smoking."
 The public responded by buying more low tar cigarettes. Gori identified American Tobacco Company’s 
Carlton Brand as  the safest cigarette and sales in 1979 of this cigarette jumped 50%.  Gori was 
accused of putting the anti-tobacco movement back years. </p>
<p>Cigarette smokers simply compensated when consuming more of the lower yielding cigarettes by smoking 
more cigarettes per day, inhaling more deeply, smoking the cigarette all the way to the filter..
 – <i>will add here manufacturers were also helping out</i>. 
In 1989, a New York Times editorial on the changing cigarette stated “Obviously no smoking is good 
but the best should not be the enemy of the good. There is strong social  case for encouraging 
 manufacturers to develop safer cigarettes that will sell."  Anonymous, Safer cigarettes. New York Times
 1989 Mar 3; Sect. A:38). 
</p>
<p>
One may agree with the premise the only “safe” cigarette is no cigarette. The major
 reason why both men and women smoke cigarettes lies in their growing dependence on nicotine. 
Benowitz and Henningfield have suggested a gradual reduction of the nicotine content of present-day
 cigarette tobaccos from 0.8-0.9 mg to 0.4-0.5 mg per cigarette as an effective measure toward preventing
 nicotine dependence. Eventually, this weaning effect should eliminate the need for cigarettes 
(Establishing a nicotine threshold for addiction: the implications for tobacco regulation NEJM 
 331: 123-5, 1994).    
</p>
<p>
Percent of smokers switching to low-tar range of 15mg or under – <i>need to get these numbers
 (it like 5% to5 85% in 10 years).</i> Possibly the tremendous increase in cigarette smoking could 
have been avoided without the growth of milder cigarettes, especially amongst women. Regular 
cigarettes were highly irritable and difficult to tolerate turning off potential smokers.
