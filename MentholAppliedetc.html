<h3><a name="Apply">Applying Menthol to Tobacco</a></h3>
<p>As we have learned (in the module on Menthol Chemistry and Many Uses) menthol
can almost completely vaporize at room temperature. This volatility of menthol
creates a major production problem in controlling the amount of this substance
added to cigarettes. Liggett and Myers had a brand of cigarettes called "10 by
10" - the pack had half menthol and half non-menthol in the same package. The
arrangement didn't work - the menthol moved or equilibrated making all the
cigarettes taste the same (Philip Morris (PM) document #2055557893).
<p>
<p>Spud Hughes, the gentleman that discovered menthol cigarettes initially had
contracted with Bloch Brothers Tobacco Co. (of Mail Pouch chewing tobacco fame)
to make Spud Menthol Cigarettes for him. Once a week Lloyd Hughes would visit
the factory to blend the menthol with the tobacco. Axton Fisher Tobacco Co.
(Louisville, KY) bought the recipe from Spud (1926) and they applied the menthol
directly to the tobacco using jet spray and re-spray of the whirling mixture,
saturating it evenly. By the way they claimed that the machine operator applying
the menthol hadn't had a cold since first being exposed to menthol. Some tobacco
companies such as Brown and Williamson (B&W;) on at least two occasions did
measure the factory air for levels of menthol just in case any toxic effects
would be reported (B&W; document #570313008).
<p>
<p>
<p>Menthol has been applied to tobacco in three different ways: it can be added
directly to the tobacco in a solution of alcohol, introduced into the cigarette
filter or applied to the paper side of the cigarette pack foil. Gallaher
Corporation (1998), Britain's hleading tobacco company, applies menthol to their
five mentholated cigarettes by placing it onto the foil backing in which
cigarette packets were wrapped. It is their hope that the menthol will vaporize
and eventually permeate the cigarettes
(//www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/cmhealth/27/0011320.htm).
<p>
<p>On July 11, 1963 Philip Morris filed a for a patent on a cigarette filter
which could incorporate a stable flavorant (such as menthol) which was released
by displacement as the attached filler rod (the tobacco portion) is smoked. The
menthol was part of a complex of a cyclodextrin or a tri-o-thymotide complex (PM
document #1000307881). Riehl et al. (1972) have shown that cigarettes initially
containing menthol on the filter do not distribute the menthol between the
filter and tobacco rod in the same proportions as cigarettes which have all
their menthol initially placed on the tobacco. (Tilford F Riehl became the Vice
President for Research & Development at Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co. -
his famous comment: "we blend for taste not nicotine".) At least one non-tobacco
company Baumgartner Papiers SA marketed a mentholated cavity filter. To learn
more about the promotion of this filter - <a href="http://file://C:/sghtml/BaumgartnerMentholFilter.html">Baumgartner Cavity
Filter</a>.
<p>A Philip Morris (PM) study (February 19, 1985) determined consumer
acceptability of Benson and Hedges 100mm cigarettes (menthol on foil) relative
to Benson and Hedges cigarettes (menthol on filter/filler). There were several
benefits associated with the menthol on foil application method: 1) it was
possible to make smaller production runs which would eliminate putting the
menthol cigarettes in cold storage 2) the was minimal cleanup (changeover from
mentholated filler to standard filler) and 3) there was also a belief that
higher levels of menthol on ultra low tar products could be obtained. Because of
the large amount of variation in the results, the menthol on foil was not be
recommended as comparable method to apply menthol to filler/filter (PM document
#2051990760_0771). In another PM study (March 17, 1977; document #2058005852) it
was concluded if the menthol was placed on the foil, a minimum of two to three
weeks would be required before shipping to allow the menthol to distribute
itself throughout the packages.

<h3><a name="Amounts">Amounts of Menthol in Cigarettes</a></h3>
<p>
<p>Approximately 90% of all cigarettes contain a very small amount of menthol.
Mentholated cigarettes contain from 0.3% to 0.7% of the tobacco weight in
menthol; a heavily mentholated cigarette would have around 1% menthol (JR Reid,
47th Tobacco Chemist's Research Conference). (So if had 100mg of tobacco the
range of menthol content would be 0.3 to 07 mg; for the very high menthol around
1mg.) The values reported for total menthol in a cigarette may not be entirely
correct if you include the menthol that may be added to the filter and the
packaging foil. For example, this analytical summary for Viginia Slims Lights
Menthol 100 (March 5, 1986) menthol, mg/cigarette, smoke 0.60, filler (contents
of rod) 3.16 and filter 1.26 (PM document #2040064126_4130).

<h5>Smoke Menthol is the number of puffs on cigarette times the amount of
menthol per puff.. </h5>
<p>
<p>Perfetti and Gordin (1985) provided information on smoke menthol (mg) and
percent pack menthol for three 'tar' categories. The average smoke menthol
delivery for full favored menthol (FF-M) was 0.54 +/- 0.05, full favored low tar
menthol (FFLT-M) 0.52 +/- 0.09 and for ultra low tart menthol (ULT-M) 0.30 +/-
0.09 (average results on 25 brands). The average applied menthol (percent pack
menthol) for each tar category was 0.39 +/- 0.05 for FF-M, 0.67 +/- 0.12 for
FFLT-M and 0.94 +/- 0.21 for ULT-M products. {Percent pack menthol is defined as
the mg of menthol that is extracted from a cigarette divided by the total weight
in mg of tobacco contained in the cigarette multiplied by 100. This assumes that
the menthol contained in a cigarette was initially placed on the tobacco.
Additionally, it was assumed that all cigarettes within a pack had the same load
of menthol.}
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>A Pierre Lorillard study (document #81361070_1088, September 19, 1973) looked
at the menthol, nicotine and dry tar content on a puff by puff basis for Kool,
Newport, Bel Air, Benson & Hedges 100 and Salem. Smoke machines smoked five
cigarettes per brand at approximately eight puffs per cigarette. It was found
that the menthol concentration of Kool increased at a rapid rate on the last two
puffs while Newport leveled out at the same stage. The other cigarettes tested
seemed to also show an increase in menthol on the last few puffs. For all the
brands there was a constant increase in nicotine concentration with each puff.
It was obvious that Kool had the largest amount of nicotine than Newport and
Alpine. (From PM document #2022244800, May 24, 1972 - king size Kool has the
highest nicotine delivery of all the king-size cigarettes available today -
menthol or non-menthol. The 100mm Kool is not the highest in nicotine delivery
but the ratio of nicotine to tar puts it in a tie for the top place.) Brands
with more Burley tobacco showed an increased menthol delivery. This occurred
because Burley tobacco burns faster so the tobacco rod would deliver more
menthol into the smoke. Another factor considered that effects the transfer of
menthol to the smoke was the initial amount of menthol placed in the tobacco. A
higher level of menthol would cause a higher total delivery of menthol but would
not cause the sharp increase of menthol in the last two puffs.

<h3><a name="Cool">Cool Sensation Concentration Dependent</a></h3>
<p>
<p>The cool sensation that results from the application of menthol to the skin
or mucosal surfaces is apparent when low or threshold concentrations of menthol
are used and is related to a direct stimulation of cold receptors. At higher
concentration menthol can have both an irritant and local anesthetic actions
when used (Eccles, 1994).
<p>
<p>Studies with mentholated cigarettes have found that a different sensation may
be experienced when a person smokes a slightly mentholated cigarette compared to
a heavily mentholated one. Brown and Williamson's people (February 17, 1987)
were concerned that Kool was loosing market share to Newport and looked at
possible reasons (document #621079918). Besides different packaging and
marketing one basic difference which could explain part of the reason was first
time smokers had a hard time adjusting to Kool - it was felt that Kool's menthol
level was too high for starters. An analytical and subjective evaluation study
of three mentholated cigarettes was conducted to determine the correlation
between menthol in smoke and cooling effect. It was found that Newport which
contained lower levels of menthol had an equivalent effect of either Alpine or
Salem. It was concluded the equivalent cooling effect that Newport delivers was
a result of added peppermint oil that increases the overall effect (Philip
Morris document #2022242164, February 13, 1963) - we doubt if this
interpretation is correct.

<h3><a name="Impact">Menthol and Nicotine "Impact" Studies</a></h3><a href="TobMenthdocs.html">To see actual paragraphs from tobacco
documents</a>..
<p>
<p>A study carried out by Philip Morris (document #2031421329_1336) April 15,
1991, evaluated 18 different cigarettes with various tar per puff, nicotine per
puff and menthol per puff combinations on nicotine "impact or strength" and
menthol perception in 39 menthol smokers. It was concluded that each of the
three variables (but especially nicotine and menthol) interact to affect
nicotine impact and menthol perception and all three need to be taken into
account when predicting impact perception. This information suggested that in
order to increase the nicotine impact of a half-nic menthol to that of a regular
menthol cigarette, the menthol per puff would need to be increased up to about
.07 (almost sure this value is milligrams since other tobacco company documents
report menthol concentration per puff in micrograms and have values ranging from
34.4 to 85.0 micrograms which would be .034 to .085 milligrams). It was realized
that increasing the menthol per puff would increase the menthol perception and
needed to be taken into account.
<p>
<p>
<p>Another Philip Morris document (#2028812249) , March 29, 1995, reported on
the effects of menthol and nicotine interaction on perceived "impact". It was
mentioned that little was known about the subjective interactions between
menthol and nicotine in cigarette smoke - specifically the effects of menthol on
nicotine-derived "impact". Cigarettes containing combinations of nicotine (0.08,
0.41 and 0.91 mg/cigarette) and four levels of menthol (0.00, 0.41, 0.85, 1.95
mg/cigarette) were used. Twenty smokers (from within the company) smoked each of
the 12 cigarette types and rated "impact" on a 7-point scale. It was found that
menthol increased "impact" for the low nicotine delivery cigarettes (0.08 and
0.41 mg/cigarette) as a function of the menthol content. The affect of menthol
was most pronounced for cigarettes with the lowest nicotine delivery. Low and
intermediate menthol levels (0.41 and 0.85 mg/cigarette) to cigarettes
delivering 0.91 mg nicotine/cigarette decreased impact. The addition of the
highest level of menthol (1.95 mg/cigarette) reduced the differences among
cigarettes, irrespective of nicotine delivery. It was concluded that menthol has
a pronounced effect on nicotine derived "impact" and should be taken into
account when targeting cigarettes for degree of perceived "impact". (INBIFO
Institut fur biologische Forschung GmbH. Koln 30 March 1995.)
<p>
<p>
<p>In another study (1975) the menthol cigarette preferences of blacks and
whites were looked at (PM document #2062951249_1265). It was concluded that
based on strength ratings, it would appear that menthol delivery may be an
important determinant of subjective strength (or smoke impact) in menthol
cigarette. The sensory expressions resulting from small variations in menthol
delivery may be greater than those resulting from small variations in nicotine
delivery. It was felt that these findings, if true, had practical consequences;
in that it may be possible to increase smoke impact in low delivery menthol
cigarettes by utilizing higher menthol delivery levels than usual.

<h3><a name="Others">Some Other Interesting Mentholated Cigarettes:</a></h3>
<p>
<p>Concord Menthol (PM document #2501008196, also 2500002401) had an adjustable
filter. Touted as the first cigarette ever that lets the smoker adjust the
menthol flavor from rich to mild. By twisting the arrow on the filter the smoker
can adjust the menthol flavor - rich when wanting a cool rich low tar and mild
when wanting a light refreshing ultra low tar.
<p>
<p>
<p>Reynolds Tobacco (RJR) introduces "Salem Pianissimo" in Japan (PM document
#20638753111 (June 29, 1995). This mentholated cigarette was suppose to reduce
side stream smoke coming off at the lit end of the cigarette and put down the
remaining scent of smoke by changing the combustion rate of cigarette paper.
According to a RJR survey, 80% of Japanese smokers were concerned that the
sidestream smoke bothers people around them and that the scent of smoke remains
in their hair, clothes and in their rooms.
<p>
<p>
<p>Northwinds (PM 1981, document #2048741135) was promoted as suddenly - a new
cigarette that cools like no menthol can. Studies on cooling agents led to the
discovery of a very active cooling compound referred to as 'coolant agent 10'
(or MPD). This compound has been used in cosmetics, soaps, dentifrices,
mouthwashes, chewing gum, tobacco and medical plasters. Coolant agent 10
resembles menthol in its ability to cause a subjective sensation of coolness but
it differs in other respects being a colorless liquid with only a faint minty
odor (Eccles, 1994).
