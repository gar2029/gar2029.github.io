<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">From its initial introduction in 1957, as a fledgling cigarette in a market dominated by 40-year
old brands, to its crowning achievement in 1993 of reaching #1 menthol status, Newport has
waged one of the most successful battles in the tobacco industry.  As a result of today's long-standing, highly successful "Alive With Pleasure" (1<sup>st</sup> used in 1972) campaign, Newport has
carved out one of the strongest and most popular brand images ever.  </font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman"> As seen in the Figure below, P. Lorillard's  Newport brand enjoyed the most significant growth of any premium brand from
3.7% of the market in 1985 to 10.3% in 2000. Marlboro, for sure still ruled the roost in 2000,
with 51.3% or five times greater than its closes competitor #2 Newport. (Tobacco Industry

<h3><a name="Beginning">In the Beginning</a></h3>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Let's look back  at the growth of Newport since its inception early in 1957. Manny Yellen, then VP for Sales and Advertising at  P. Lorillard (1967 became President, 1970
President and Chairman of the Board) had been involved with Newport since its inception and
was responsible for its marketing philosophy. </font></b></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">A the time Newport was ready to go in early 1957 with an advertising budget of approximately
\\$900,000, the Liggett & Myers brand Oasis
<img src="OasisMentholCigarettes.jpg" align="right">
was brought out with a six month advertising budget
of six and one-half million dollars. At this time the Menthol Category consisted of  Kool
cigarettes that had a therapeutic image. Salem cigarettes brought out in 1956 with a substantial
budget was already on its way with a new menthol image of "refreshing taste."  </font></b></p>
<br wp="BR1"><p><b><font face="Times New Roman">It was realized that Newport would not stand a chance with all the menthol brands going down
the same road. Yellen indicated they had to sell a certain type of person on the Newport brand
until such a time Lorillard could establish a sufficient volume to make the brand profitable and
then gradually change the image to obtain other types of smokers. Newport with its hint of mint was marked as a
"fun cigarette" - it was advertised as such and obtained a youthful group as well as an immature
group of smokers. </font></b></p>
<blockquote> <i> Newport probably got its name from the Newport Jazz Festival that has been held annually since 1954. This is one
one of the oldest jazz festivals organized in Newport, RI by Louis Lorillard and Elaine Lorillard who administered it through a non-proft corporation. The original cigarette pack introduced in 1957, probably reflects the original pitch: the elegant,
by-the-sea life of leisure is conjured up by the abstracted, wind-filled sail and the easy marine blue of the package. The upside down Nike swoosh was probably just a portion of a wind wind-filled sail. The Nike swoosh was designed by graphic artist, Carolyn Davidson in 1971 and is the trademark that adorns Nike products. </i>
</blockquote>
<center>
<img height="80" width="250" src="SwooshNewportNike.jpg"> </center>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">The plan was to reach a sales volume of five billion cigarettes annually and then gradually
change the advertising philosophy to secure additional types of smokers. In 1963 they were able
to start the change  in advertising but before sufficient penetration they were hit with the 1964
Surgeon General's  report. By the end of 1964 sales of Newport were down 22.5% .  Though the
new campaign "Newport Tastes Fresher, Tastes Better Too, Than Any Other Menthol Cigarettes"
had started it did not have sufficient penetration to notice any favorable sales effect.</font></b></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><b> With the expanded menthol market, it can be seen from the Table below that for the four established brands from 1957 through 1960, Salem and Newport made the most significant gains. The other two brands - Kool and Oasis - did not contribute much to the growth of the general menthol market. The recent rise of the "all other" group is due to the introduction of the new brands that had not established a foothold yet. </b></p>

<h3><a name="Continual">Continual Growth</a></h3>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Newport began its present growth trend in 1973 following a six year decline. The decline was
primarily caused by the repositioning the product which included changes in its advertising, packaging and
product. A 1965 product comparison revealed that Newport was a very light product (lack of
tobacco taste) compared with Salem and Kool as it had much less tar and nicotine. </font></b></p>

from 15.8mg in 1965 to 22.3mg by 1969. It appears they recognized that the brand's low level of
strength and tobacco taste were probably holding the brand back. In 1975, Newport seemed to
have received the push it needed as Kool made several product changes. Kool changed the
character of its product in 1975 and went from the then fastest growing brand to the fastest
declining brand. </font></b></p>

<p> <b><font face="Times New Roman">B1G1F (Buy One Get One Free) - the primary purpose of a B1G1F offer was to create new trial
and resultant new customers. It was felt that Newport was unique in that its demographics placed
it in the young adult category with varying dominance between white and black consumers, also
sales were primarily by package rather then carton. Therefore, the goal of increased trials was
best served by placing displays in primarily package sale locations frequented by young adults.  </font> </b></p>
<br wp="BR1"><br wp="BR2">
<p> <b><font face="Times New Roman">Sampling - it was felt the most effective tool for trial generation (to get smoker to switch or try it
for the first time) was sampling. One program recommended in 1977 was to send supervised
crews to knock on doors/ring doorbells and ask if a smoker over 21 resides at the
house/apartment, screen for menthol smoking/menthol proneness and if appropriate leave a
Newport sample with brandsell leaflet and 20 cent next purchase pack coupon. Using this
sampling approach it was felt the conversion rate was 2.5%.</font>  </b></p>

<p> <b><font face="Times New Roman"> Richard Kluger's book <u>Ashes to Ashes</u> (pg 700) mentions a time when Lorillard was caught in
the act of sampling youngsters with Newports from a van painted green and orange and bearing
the brand's slogan, "Alive with Pleasure," in large letters on the streets of the nation's capital.
When confronted Lorillard stated, "We do not give cigarettes to children," and blamed the
incident on the carelessness of its hired dispensers. Lorilland did have a Sampling Procedure
(12/18/90) in place that stated that it was imperative that you (the dispenser) do not give
samples to any one who appears to be (under  21 years of age). </font> </b></p>

<h3><a name="Strategic">Strategic Focus - the Marketing Plan for the Next Generation</a> </h3>
<p> <b><font face="Times New Roman">Strategic Focus - 1994 began Newport's next generation with a marketing plan designed to
solidify its position in the industry. It was felt through 'strategic focus' they would be able to
segment the geography according to each market's needs, and to pinpoint their promotion and
advertising efforts. It was felt such a marketing plan was needed because total U.S. Sales
volume was down 5% in 1993 versus the previous year. </font></b></p>
<br wp="BR1"><br wp="BR2">
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">In 1994 Newport cigarettes continued to be an ethnically skewed brand and holds a very sizeable share of
market among the black smoker market. Driven by a powerful peer acceptance factor behind the
Newport name, the brand was currently riding the crest of ethnic appeal in key urban
areas of New York, Chicago, Detroit and other cities.</font></b></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">In 1993 Kool sales decreased by 16% nationally - volume decrease by 15% on the U.S.. For
Salem, 1993 showed tremendous volume losses throughout the country, by year's end Salem
volume decrease by 23%. </font></b></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">The consideration of Image and Price were the two factors for the new way of marketing
Newport in the next generation. The objective was to restore long-term volume stability and to
take Newport into the next generation. It was felt that strong brand Image was Newport's
biggest asset but the product was vulnerable to the Price because of deep discounts offered by
minor players. </font></b></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p> <b><font face="Times New Roman">The first application of "Strategic Focus" was to Newport's marketing geographies. Each
division was re-evaluated against the Image and Price factors and each was classified into one of
five, different marketing categories or TIERS. </font></b></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">A brief description of the five TIERS follows. </font></b></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p> <b><font face="Times New Roman">TIER 1 - consumer sales in these divisions are heavily motivated by brand Image and not
seriously affected by the Price value factor. This market represents 22% of the U.S. population
and 44% of Newport's volume. The majority of this Tier is in the eastern part of the U.S., in big
cities like NewYork, New Jersey and Boston. This is consistent with past years, when Newport's
highest share where core markets were located mainly along the east coast. The marketing
startegy is to continue to leverage Newport's highly popular image to maintain its high share
performance.</font></b></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p> <b><font face="Times New Roman">TIER 2 - consumer sales in market strongly motivated by Image but the Price factor has also
become a key player. These divisions total 16% of the U.S. population and 27% of Newport's
volume. These markets are very Price sensitive and accounted for the greatest percentage of
1993's losses. The majority of this Tier tend to be big metropolitan areas like Philadelphia,
Chicago and Detroit. The marketing plans here require a bigger investment because both the
Image and Price factors have to be addressed through promotions and advertising.</font></b></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">TIER 3 - in these divisions, Newport's image is underdeveloped but the menthol category
overall is still popular.  Savings is still important in this Tier but these markets seem to show
response to image building efforts on Newport's part.  These divisions account for 16% of the
population and 12% of Newport's volume. For the most part, Tier 3's opportunity markets are
concentarted in the midwest to the south and southeast area of the U.S. Atlanta, Canton and
Charlotte are a few examples. Attention for Tier 3 will focus much more on building the brand
through fighting price sensitivity than on establishing its image.</font> </b></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">TIER 4 - markets represent the largest part of the U.S. population 29% and 14% of Newport's
volume. This Tier has the most scattered group, these are markets that have within them pockets
of strength. Divisions such as Gand Rapids, Los Angeles North and Sarasota are some of the
members of this geography.</font></b></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">TIER 5 - comprised of 17% of the U.S. population but accounts for only 3% of Newport's
volume.  This Tier represents the smallest opportunity for Newport, is spread throughout the
midwest and west and over to the west coast.  Plan here is to provide low levels of support, in
order to secure volume base and insure brand distribution. </font> </b></p>
<br wp="BR1">
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Advertising and promotion programs have been created to respond to the needs of each Tier
individually  In general, promotions will emphasize programs that bring the brand's Image to life
for consumers - to make them feel that they are actually purchasing the experience of being
"Alive With Pleasure" when they buy a Newport.  Further - to reinforce the brand's "Pleasure"
image among younger adult smokers. For each Tier, as the ratio of Image to Price factors
change, so too will the mix and variety of Image- based programs to Price-sensitivity-based
programs provided.  </font> </b></p>
<p> <b><font face="Times New Roman">Another fear for Lorillard was brought about by the MSA (Master Settlement Agreement)  settlement. Steve Watson, VP of
external affairs for Lorillard indicated the greatest fear is that minor manufacturers not
associated with the MSA settlement have circumvented the payments being made to the states.
As a result they can provide deeper discounts than Lorillard can afford to offer retailers.  "It's
made all the manufacturers susceptible to marketshare loss and we think that's a competitive
disadvantage to our brands" says Watson.  The proof of that, he says, is that the share of  "one of
the minor manufacturers - I think it's Commonwealth - is even larger than that of Liggett brands
combined and it's growing steadily.". </font> </b></p>
