industrial empire founded on the humble of innovations - the Swedish-made safety match. (To read more about this most interesting man

Snuff/Snus <br>
<p>
Sweden is the world's largest snuff market measured by per capita consumption. In Sweden, a substantially larger proportion of the male
 population uses the Swedish type of moist snuff called snus(1) compared to cigarettes. The Norwegian market, which is significantly smaller
 than the Swedish market, is at present showing strong growth. The US is the world's largest snuff market measured in number of cans and is approximately five times larger than the Swedish market. In Sweden and Norway, Swedish Match has a leading position. (in Sweden SW – 90.5%, F&L;/HOP – 5.3%, Gallaher 2.8%, all others – 1.4%)

<p>For Swedish Match the largest growth potential is in the categories of snuff and cigars.</p>
Snuff /Snus <br>
<p>Swedish Match is by far the largest producers of snus in the Nordic Market and is also well positioned in the United States snuff value segment –
 sitting 3rd behind UST and RJR-Conwood. 
The United States snuff market is the world’s largest, has the most rapid growth and has increased by 6% or more per year in volume terms in recent 
years.  Swedish Match is goal is to grow at least as rapidly as the market. 
During the third quarter (2007), sales revenues increased by 8 percent compared to the same quarter previous year, to 852 MSEK (785), and operating 
profit decreased by less than 1 percent, to 383 MSEK (385). Currency translation impacts have affected the sales and operating profit comparison 
negatively. Operating profit improved in the Scandinavian snus business. The Company has increased spending (including launch related costs for
 Red Man moist snuff) which has resulted in a somewhat lower operating profit in the US snuff business. During the year, the Company has 
increased its marketing and product development spending overall in the snuff product category for both the US and Scandinavian markets. 
Operating margin was 45.0 percent (49.1). 
In Scandinavia, shipment volume in cans, during the third quarter were down less than 1 percent compared to the same period previous year. 
The destocking effects from a hoarding in Sweden in the fourth quarter of 2006 have ended. Increased volumes in Norway and Duty free offset
 Swedish volume declines. 
In the US, overall shipment volumes in cans during the third quarter were up by 34 percent compared to the same period previous year. Volumes
 for Longhorn and Timber Wolf combined were up by 28 percent. Shipment volumes for the launch of Red Man moist snuff contributed to the overall 
volume increase. The Red Man launch was supported by extensive marketing efforts. 
For the first nine months of the year, sales amounted to 2,308 MSEK (2,400) while operating profit amounted to 925 MSEK (1,151). Operating margin
 was 40.1 percent (48.0). The lower operating margin results from a combination of factors including lower volumes in the first half of the year 
in Scandinavia, a mix shift toward value price products, and higher marketing expenses for product launches. 
Swedish snus is moist snuff which is produced using a special heat treated process, much like pasteurization as opposed to other snuff products
 for which a fermentation process is used. 
Gothiatek is the Swedish Match quality standard for Snus. 
Moist Snuff – Longhorn and Timber Wolf (Wolf Packs) and now RE Man Moist Snuff. Red Man MTS was launched ib test markets in 10 United States 
sites at the beginning of September 2007 and is available in three varieties: Long Cut Straight, Long Cut Wintergreen and Fine Cut Natural. 
While the American snuff market is growing steadily the market for chewing tobacco is declining.
