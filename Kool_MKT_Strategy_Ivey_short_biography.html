<p>Susan Ivey is currently the President and CEO of the newly formed Reynolds American, Inc. rose through the ranks of
 Brown & Williamson.</p>
<p>
Mrs. Ivey got her start at Brown & Williamson in 1981 when she called a marketing official to complain that she couldn't 
find any Barclay Menthol cigarettes to purchase. They asked if she wanted to come aboard as a trade marketing
 representative. She claims she's still smoking the same cigarettes in 2004.  She became a distributor of cigarettes
to retail outlets in Kentucky, was promoted district sales manager in 1983 and served in a number of managerial roles,
 including Vice President 
of Marketing in 1990. Ivey was offered a job as brand director in London by BAT PLC, B&W;'s parent company. After
 remaining in England until 1994 she became the director of marketing at BAT in Hong Kong. In 1996 she transferred back
 to London, where she served as manager of international brand. In 1997 she married Trevor Ivey.</p>
<p>
Then she got an opportunity to return the  United States as  Senior Vice President of marketing and a member of the
 company's executive 
committee in 1999.  She worked in this position for about a year when she got the call to become the leader of B&W.;
 So some 18 years after starting with the company - she was named the President and CEO of the nation's 3rd largest 
cigarettes manufacturer.</p>
<p>Ivey was looked on as the savior since the company was still reeling from the results of the Master Settlement
 Agreement. </p>
<p>People felt Ivey could breath a renewed outlook into a business that was faltering.</p>
<p>Her day begins with a cardiovascular workout session for 45 minutes
 something she claims she had done since
 the age of 17.  We all know that tobacco smoking and physical active life are not compatible.  Studies show that
 exercising can help a smoker to quit. If Susan Ivey is still smoking, we wonder if she has difficulty in catching 
her breath, fatigues easily and suffers from frequent respiratory 
infections. </p>
