<h2>The Window of Opportunity</h2>
<p align="left">
One of the greatest fears we all face is being told we have cancer. Immediately
this devastation evokes fears of death, of uncontrollable pain, of physical
dependence and of the inability to any longer protect those that we love.
</p>
<p align="left">
What have we accomplished with the billions and billions of dollars that have
been spent over the last 28 years on finding a cure for cancer. Death rates
from cancer of the lung, breast, pancreas, colon, bladder, prostate and
pharynx have barely changed. Oncologists talk about their successes in terms
of improved therapies and improved educational programs for clinicians and
the general public.
</p> 
<p align="left">
Is this really good enough. One in every four people that die will die of 
cancer. About 1.2 million cancer cases will be diagnosed in 1998 and half
a million will lose their lives. Just think everyday 1500 people in the
U.S. die of cancer.

Cancer treatment often gives rise to side effects so harmful they compromise
the benefits of treatment. Because these therapies often fail, physicians
talk to their patients about chances of survival instead of providing solid 
assurances of recovery. Drug doses necessary to kill cancer cells also 
kill fast growing healthy cells such as those generating blood, hair, or
the lining of the mouth, stomach and intestine. The resulting side effects:
hair loss, nausea and diarrhea can be unpleasant or worse with not enough 
blood cells death by infection or bleeding can occur in a few weeks. All of 
this unpleasantness is usually accompanied by pain. U.S. studies have shown
that at least one-third of all cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy
or other anti-tumor treatment and two-thirds of those with advanced cancer 
suffer significant discomfort. This unrelenting pain can erode a patient's
willingness to continue treatment or even to live. Even the Director of the
National Cancer Institute has complained that people are frustrated with the
inadequacy of the current therapies.

Oncologists compliment themselves on a job well done and insist they're doing 
the best they can do to treat the disease. Everyone hopes that ongoing 
genetic research will find that unique gene will provide the instant cure.
Soon into the next century the Human Genome Project will be completed and we
will have a complete description of the DNA sequence. But before this work
can be meaningful scientists still need to identify these genes' and under what
conditions this gene products (proteins) express themselves.

Is there a possibility we can prevent cancer from unfolding; avoiding this 
misery and possible death. Scientists tell us that cancer is initiated
when more than one mutation (an alteration in the genetic makeup) occurs 
in a single cell. These mutations are quite common and occur in just about
all cells in a person's body. Now the cell has a number of defense mechanisms
to correct these alterations in genetic material. It's when these safeguards
are overwhelmed (do not function properly) that you can have the start of
carcinogenesis. The expression of cancer is usually a stepwise process that 
may take 20 to 30 years to unfold.
</p>
<p align="left">
So when informed by your doctor that you have a cancerous growth, it's most
likely this cancer had been unfolding for several years before reaching this 
stage of diagnosis. If there was just some way to strengthen the defense 
mechanism to control this increase in mutations maybe this unfolding of the
cancer could have been avoided.
<p align="left">
Studies have demonstrated that there are corrective measures that can be taken
to reduce the chance of cancer from ever occurring. Dr. Michael Sporn has
pointed out that cardiovascular intervention strategies have been 
successful in reducing deaths from heart disease. The same could be done for
cancer. With the proper prevention program then cancer could be prevented
from getting started or stopped at its beginning rather than at a terminal 
stage. In fact, cancer prevention programs could be an extension of existing
heart disease prevention programs. The major components are quite similar: no
tobacco products, eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, exercise regularly,
avoid weight gains, reduce the intake of red meats and avoid excessive 
alcohol consumption. Other "common sense factors" include: avoid risky 
sexual practices and see that the proper authorities provide better control
of known carcinogens in the environment and the workplace. (It has been shown
that people that practice a lifestyle of abstinence seem to have an overall
lower cancer death rate.)
</p>

Dr. Lee Wattenberg's studies over the last 25 or more years have even 
identified and characterized the specific chemicals in fruits and vegetables
that help fight cancer from ever occurring. Clinical studies have shown that
the ingestion of nutrient supplements and certain medications can reverse and
suppress carcinogenesis. More research is needed to find natural or synthetic
substances that "boost" the mechanisms that control the increase in mutations
thus preventing or controlling the cancer before it becomes impossible to
control. It has been found that a drug called tamoxifen may prevent breast
cancer in women with increased risk but also may increase the risk of 
endometrial cancer. Research studies (Dr. Sporn & colleagues) are now
underway in animals to see if you can administer lower doses of this 
medication, avoiding its serious side effect, by using it in combination
with derivatives of vitamin A (retinoids) or vitamin D (deltanoids).

It has been estimated that if prevention programs (similar to what was briefly
described above) were established there would be a reduction in cancer 
mortality by at least one-third even without new discoveries or
technological development. Probably, to be most effective a person would 
have to start this program before the age of 30. After the age of 30 the 
incidence of cancer rises exponentially with increasing age.
