<h3>Nitrosamines</h3>
Nitrosamines are a class of chemical compounds that were first described in the chemical literature over 100 years ago,
 but not until 1956 did they receive much attention. In that year two British scientists, John Barnes and Peter Magee, 
reported that dimethylnitrosamine produced liver tumors in rats. This discovery was made during a routine screening of chemicals that were being proposed for use as solvents in the dry cleaning industry. 
Magee and Barnes' landmark discovery caused scientists around the world to investigate the carcinogenic properties of
 other nitrosamines and N-nitroso compounds. Approximately 300 of these compounds have been tested, and 90% of them
 have been found to be carcinogenic in a wide variety of experimental animals. Most nitrosamines are mutagens and a 
number are transplacental carcinogens. Most are organ specific. For instance, dimethylnitrosamine causes liver cancer 
in experimental animals, whereas some of the tobacco specific nitrosamines cause lung cancer. Since nitrosamines are 
metabolized the same in human and animal tissues, it seems highly likely that humans are susceptible to the carcinogenic 
properties of nitrosamines.
<p>Tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) are widely considered to be among the most important carcinogens in smokeless
tobacco products and cigarette smoke. Two of these tobacco-alkaloid derived compounds,
 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) 
N'-nitrosonor-nicotine (NNN), are consistently carcinogenic in labortaory animals, with NNK showing higher
activity. The other two commonly measured TSNAs are N'-nitrosoanabasine (NAB) and N'-nitrosoanatabine (NAT).
NAB is a weak carcinogen and NAT apparently lacks activity. NNK and NNN have been evaluated by the International
Agency for Research on Cancer (2005)as carcinogenic to humans. </p>  
<p>For the last 40 years, American farmers growing flue-cured tobacco have cured leaves through direct-fired systems that
 burn natural or LP gas. This method has been found to produce TSNA's, or tobacco specific nitrosamines. Nitrosamines are
 produced when nitrous oxides, a product of combustion, combine with nicotine in tobacco leaves. Tobacco specific nitrosamines 
have been shown to be carcinogenic. Research has shown that if such direct-fired systems are retrofitted with heat exchangers, 
tobacco specific nitrosamines can be dramatically reduced.  </p>

<p> Origin of Tobacco-Specific Nitrosaminese<br>
The importance of the tobacco curing process. The drying (curing) of green tobacco is an extremely
delicate process, since tobacco must not be allowed to dry to the point that it crumbles. Incorrrect
curing can result in the growth of bacteria in the tobacco leaves. The bacteria then form nitrite,
 which in turn reacts chemically with alkaloids to form nitrosamines. In an unfortune combination 
of circumstances, the nitrosamine content can become very high. Fire-cured tobacco,
 which contains other undesired components as well, such as benzopyrene. (Swedish Match - GothiaTek).</p>
