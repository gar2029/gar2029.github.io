<h2>Julep Cigarettes</h2>
<p> </p>
<br wp="BR1"><br wp="BR2">
 <p><b>Julep cigarettes were marketed first by the <u>(1)</u> Julep Cigarette
Company of  Boston and Hahira, Georgia about 1935, then later (we think around 1941) by <u>(2)</u> Penn Tobacco Company of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania and
finally around 1958 by <u>(3)</u> Brown and Williamson. The relationship of these companies to each other is not known. We do not know at this time (11/2001) if Juleps contained menthol. In fact,  one company, Penn Tobacco Co., made it a point in their promotional material to emphasis: "Do not confuse new Juleps with menthol-tasting cigarettes."</b>

<br wp="BR1">
<p><b> <u>1.</u> Julep Cigarette Co. of Boston and Hahira, Georgia - there is a possible connection with Lloyd F. Hughes (nicknamed Spud) the discover of menthol cigarettes and the first to market a menthol called Spud. For more information <a href="SPUD1.html">on Spud Hughes and the origin of menthol cigarettes.</a> In the summer of 1928 Spud Hughes was about to run out of money from the sale of his business to Axton-Fisher Tobacco Co.. He went to Brooklyn, got a job first in a filling station, then as a postman and worked at night on a new cigarette Julep. When last seen in 1932 Spud, his wife and their three children, riding in a \\$75 automobile and peddling cigarettes on the way, headed toward Hahira, Georgia where he was trying to make Juleps into another great money maker (Fortune, November 1932).
</b> </p>
<p><b> A commercial cigarette manufacturing plant was built in Hahira, Georgia in 1926. When the factory first opened it manufactured "Oteen" cigarettes until the depression hit in 1929.  </p>
<p>The factory stayed idle until about 1935 when it was purchased by the Julep Cigarette Company of
Boston Massachusetts. The factory was called the Julep Cigarette Tobacco Company of Hahira and
manufactured , "Julep" cigarettes which were sold nationwide. After a few years the factory closed
and all cigarette making equipment was removed <a href="http://www.hahira.ga.us/cigfactory.htm">http:www.hahira.ga.us/cigfactory.htm</a> </b> </p>
<p><b> The FTC described the Julep Tobacco Co., a corporation, 31 State Street, Boston, Mass, as a  vendor/advertiser and was engaged in selling Julep Cigarettes. In the cease and desist order (September 27, 1938) the FTC accused the company of falsely misrepresenting Julep cigarettes  by claiming the cigarette never makes the throat dry or parched, they do not tire the appetite, they "banish" morning after, stale mouth taste, counteract irritants present in tobacco and may have a therapeutic action on the throat. </b> </p>

<p><b>The Penn Tobacco Company had been formed just after the turn of the Century. On January 1, 1901,
the Penn factory consisted of Henry Weigand, as Superintendent, another man, six girls and one
cutting machine valued at \\$750.00. The two men prepared the tobacco for the girls to hand-pack.
Then, Weigand, who later became president of the Penn Company, would harness their horse,
"Flute," to the buggy and peddle the tobacco from store to store. To introduce the tobacco, he and
a few girls would visit the local unions at night and pass out samples. This first tobacco product of
the Penn Company, <strong><a href="SterlingPennTobaccoCo.gif">Penn's Stripped</a>. </b> </p>
<p><b>Kentucky Club</strong> first appeared in the depression year of 1934, as a rough-cut smoking mixture in
a pocket-size paper package. About one year later it was marketed in a pocket tin in its present form
-- fine-cut. Other products include a smoking tobacco for pipe or cigarette called <a href="HoneyMoonTinPennTobacco.jpg">Honey Moon. </a> <a href="http://wheeling.weirton.lib.wv.us/history/bus/bloch-54.htm">http://wheeling.weirton.lib.wv.us/history/bus/bloch-54.htm</a>.</b> </p>

<li>
1. No 'stale-tasting mouth: New miracle mint in Julep freshens the mouth at every puff. Even if you chain-smoke, your mouth feels clean, sparkling all day long. <li>
2. No raw 'burned-out' throat: Miracle mint stays in the smoke of Juleps, refreshes the thraot. No "dry-as-dust" rawness, even if you smoke 20-40-60 Juleps a day. <li>
3. No heavy 'tobacco-breath': Unpleasant tobacco-breath is a common form of halitosis. But... the hint of mint in Juleps lingers, leaves your breath pleasant and inviting." </li> <b></p>

The FTC accused Penn of misrepresenting the Julep Cigarettes with promotional phrases like "Remember Juleps, forget your cough" and from the use of the words "forget your cough" implying the cigarette was a treatment or remedy for coughs.

<p><b>In 1943, Bloch Brothers purchased the Penn Tobacco Company of Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania.
Production was carried on in the Wilkes-Barre factory over a period of almost five years before the
machinery was shipped to Wheeling. <u>It is extremely interesting to us that Bloch Brothers (of Mail Pouch chewing tobacco fame) of Wheeling, West Virginia that Spud Hughes contracted with Bloch to first make his Spud mentholated cigarettes. Once a week Spud would visit the factory to blend the tobacco (Fortune, November 1932).  <center><img src="BlochBrotherTobaccoCo.jpg"> </center> </u> </b></p>
