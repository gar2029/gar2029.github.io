  <b>Acceptable Use Guidelines</b><p>
    <p><b>Introduction.</b>  Please read these Guidelines for Acceptable Use carefully.  Together with the Terms of Service and the other documents, agreements and materials incorporated therein (collectively referred to as the “Rules”), they govern your use of the Services provided to you by United Online Web Services.     The most current version of the Rules may be found at the Site related to your Service.
  <p><b>Content.</b>  While United Online Web Services encourages and supports the free flow of information and ideas over the Internet, United Online Web Services expects that you will act legally, responsibly and be considerate of others.  United Online Web Services reserves the right, but does not bear the responsibility, to prohibit or delete any conduct, communication or content which United Online Web Services in its sole discretion determines to be unlawful, potentially harmful to others or may expose United Online Web Services to harm or liability.  By content, we mean the text, software, communications, images, sounds and other information provided online, hosted or transmitted in connection with or as a result of the Services provided to you.  You agree that all claims, disputes or wrongdoing which result from, or which are related in any way to, the content of information that you transmit, re-transmit, host or receive through the Services are your sole and exclusive responsibility.
  <p>If you post, upload or transmit content or material to your personal website, or public areas (e.g. message boards, newsgroups, forums and public mailing lists), you are requesting United Online Web Services and/or its partners to make such content available to others, and you understand that such parties may copy, modify or distribute such materials.  Additionally, you are representing that you are the owner of such material or have authorization to distribute it anywhere, and you expressly grant United Online Web Services the complete right to use, reproduce, modify and/or distribute the content in any form, anywhere.
  <p>United Online Web Services does not generally monitor the conduct of its users nor communication or content distributed, hosted or posted through the Services, and you acknowledge United Online Web Services is unlikely to be aware of violations of law or these Rules or other misconduct occurring through the Services.  If you send an online communication (e.g., e-mail, posting, instant message), host or post any content, you bear full responsibility for the content.  You are responsible for using reasonable efforts to screen any unwanted material and reporting any offensive or illegal communications to United Online Web Services.
  <p><b>Unlawful Purposes.</b>  You may not transmit, distribute, host  or store material, or participate in any conduct, that may violate any applicable local, state, federal or foreign law or regulation.  This includes, without limitation:

  <p>Notification of copyright infringement or any other illegal activity should be sent to:
  <p>Jeanne Berges, Esq., United Online Web Services, c/o United Online Inc., 21255 Burbank Boulevard, Suite 400, Woodland Hills, CA 91367

  <ul>
  <li>a physical description or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on the copyright owner;

Subscribers may be fined US $200.00 for each day this provision is violated.
