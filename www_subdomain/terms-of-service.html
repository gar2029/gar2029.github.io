  <b>Terms Of Service</b><p>
    United Online Web Services, Inc. (&#8220;United Online Web Services&#8221;), a United Online Company, provides various consumer Internet subscription services including, without limitation, Internet web sites, web hosting services, domain registration, e-mail services and other services (collectively, the &#8220;Services&#8221;) under multiple brands including, without limitation, emailMyName, mySite, FreeServers, 50megs, Community Architect, and BizHosting.  These Terms and Conditions, the Privacy Statement, the Acceptable Use Guidelines and any material details or terms related to your Service and account that are provided to you in your registration process (including any billing policies), all of which are referred to collectively as the &#8220;Rules,&#8221; govern your use of the Services.  You cannot have an account with us unless you have agreed to the Rules by completing the registration process for, or by using, the Services, and each use of the Service constitutes your reaffirmation of your acceptance of the Rules.  Please review the most current Rules at the website for the particular brand of your Services (with respect to a particular Service, the &#8220;Site&#8221;) prior to accessing the Services.  The Services are only available to residents of the United States and Canada unless otherwise specified. 
  <p>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE RULES, YOU MUST DISCONTINUE THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, DISCONTINUE YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, DESTROY ALL OF YOUR COPIES OF THE SOFTWARE AND, IF YOU ARE ALREADY A MEMBER, CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT.
  <p><b>1.	Changes to the Rules and Services Apply to You.</b>  You may review the most current version of the Rules at the Site.  United Online Web Services may change pricing, the Rules, or change the scope of the Services, in whole or in part, at any time at United Online Web Servicesâ€™ sole discretion.  Posting of such changed Rules on the Site shall constitute notice of such changes to you, although United Online Web Services may choose additional types of notice.  United Online Web Services will use reasonable efforts to provide you with 30 days advance notice of changes to the Rules that materially and adversely impact your use of the Services.  Your continued use of the Services following notice constitutes your acceptance of all changes.  If you do not agree to any such changes, your sole and exclusive remedy is to cancel your account as described below.
  <p><b>2.	Your Responsibilities.</b>
  <p><b>Use of Your Account.</b>  You are responsible for all use of your account, so you must protect your password and any other methods of accessing your account or the Services.  Except as expressly allowed hereunder, you may not transfer or permit any other person to use your user name or your account.  United Online Web Services owns your user name, any associated password, e-mail addresses, website and any domain name (unless you purchased the complete rights to the entire domain name), and reserves the right to take or terminate the use of any such user name, e-mail address, website and domain name at any time.  For the purpose of clarification, most consumer based products and services offered by United Online Web Services do not include the complete rights to any domain name.
  <p><b>Minors.</b>  You must be 18 years old to establish an account for paid Services, and you represent that you are at least 18 years old by registering for such Services.  Parents may obtain an account for the Services for minors, and by doing so, consent to such minorâ€™s use of such Services.  Parents assume full responsibility and liability associated with a minor's use of any of the Services.
  <p><b>Completion of Questionnaires, Surveys, Registration.</b>   As a condition of United Online Web Services providing the Services, you agree to provide United Online Web Services with accurate and complete information as requested from time to time, through questionnaires, surveys and registration forms.  You must register for the Services in your own name.  You agree that United Online Web Services may verify the accuracy of any information you submit and may cancel or terminate your account or your use of the Services if your information is inaccurate.  
  <p><b>Accessing Services.</b>  United Online Web Services does not provide Internet access service needed to access or use the Services unless otherwise specified.  You are responsible for providing your own access to the Internet and are responsible for obtaining and maintaining, at your own expense, all input/output devices or equipment (such as computer, modem and software) and communications services (including, without limitation, long distance or local telephone service) necessary to use the Services.  You are responsible for ensuring such equipment and services are compatible with the Services.  
  <p><b>3.	Charges and Billing.</b>
  <p><b>Fees.</b>  You are responsible for and agree to pay all fees, charges and taxes incurred as a result of using the Services.  You understand that in addition to any standard subscription fees, there may be additional fees including, without limitation, fees for supplemental services, premium features, customer support, telephone charges, purchases made through the use of the Services and any taxes.  Unless otherwise indicated, all prices are quoted and billed in U.S. dollars.
  <p><b>Payment.</b>  All amounts are non-refundable and due when you are billed by United Online Web Services.  United Online Web Services will assess a late fee of 1.5% per month (or the highest amount permissible by law, whichever is less) for any amounts not paid when due.  You will be liable for any fees, including any late fees, imposed by or incurred by United Online Web Services with respect to late payments and the collection thereof.  United Online Web Services may suspend or terminate any delinquent, unbillable or uncollectable accounts.  Charges will continue to accrue until the account is canceled.  United Online Web Services may assess a service charge to reinstate a suspended account.  You must bring any billing problems or discrepancies to United Online Web Servicesâ€™ attention within 90 days from the date you are billed or you agree that you waive your right to dispute such problems or discrepancies with United Online Web Services.   
  <p><b>Payment Method.</b>  You expressly authorize United Online Web Services to charge all fees incurred in connection with the Services to your selected billing method, including charges that may occur on an automatic or recurring basis, and such authorization shall remain valid until revoked by you by canceling any Service for which a fee is charged as described herein.  You agree to report to United Online Web Services all changes to your selected billing method information within 30 days of the change.  Some fees that you may incur using the Services may accumulate on your United Online Web Services account before they are charged to your selected billing method.  Once the charges appear on your account, you are responsible for payment of such charges.  If you have any billing-related questions, call the toll-free billing support number set forth on the Site for your particular Service.
  <p><b>4.	Termination, Cancellation, Renewals and Refunds.</b>
  <p><b>Separate Billing Policy.</b>  If your Service includes a separate billing policy, such policy is incorporated herein and the terms of such policy apply to the Service and supplement the Terms and Conditions.  In the event of any conflict between the Terms and Conditions and the terms in the billing policy, the terms of billing policy shall prevail.
  <p><b>Rights.</b>  Either you or United Online Web Services may terminate or cancel your account for any reason at any time.  You understand and agree that all payments to United Online Web Services are non-refundable and that the cancellation of your account is your sole remedy with respect to any dispute or disagreement with United Online Web Services.  If your Services are cancelled for any reason, you may lose access to any content, e-mail services or messages, storage, access to your domain and website or other materials or features provided with the Services, including materials or content that you may have uploaded or posted to any United Online Web Services public areas.  Termination of the Services will not excuse you from any criminal or other civil liabilities.  You understand when you register for the Services you have agreed, without future notice, to be charged on an ongoing basis unless you take affirmative steps to cancel the Service.  If United Online Web Services terminates your Service, you may be prohibited from subsequently  registering for such Service or any other Services.
  <p><b>Your Cancellation Procedures.</b>  You can cancel the Services by following the instructions on the Site.  Your termination is not complete until processed by United Online Web Services and charges will continue to accrue until termination is complete.  Processing is normally done within 72 hours of your request.   
  <p><b>Refunds.</b>  Upon cancellation, you will not receive a refund and the Service will remain active until the end of your agreed-to term unless otherwise disclosed with respect to your Service or United Online Web Services elects to allow otherwise.
  <p><b>Free Trials.</b>  If you have subscribed to a Service with a free trial period, you must cancel the Service prior to the end of the applicable trial period in order to avoid incurring any applicable subscription fees.  Although you may be entitled to use the Service during the trial period without paying a subscription fee, you understand that you may incur, and are responsible for, any fees for supplemental services, premium features, customer support, telephone charges, other Services and purchases made through the use of the Service during the trial period.
  <p><b>Early Termination Fee.</b> Your Service may include a minimum term commitment (see your service plan description). Your minimum term begins on your the billing start date. IN THE EVENT THAT YOU TERMINATE (OR TAKE AN ACTION THAT CAUSES TERMINATION OF) YOUR SERVICE BEFORE SATISFYING THE MINIMUM TERM COMMITMENT UNDER YOUR PLAN, THEN YOU AGREE TO PAY UNITED ONLINE WEB SERVICES UPON DISCONTINUANCE OF THE SERVICE A TERMINATION FEE AS SET FORTH IN YOUR PLAN DESCRIPTION (THE "EARLY TERMINATION FEE").
  <p><b>5.	Limitations on Your Use.</b>
  <p><b>Services in General.</b>  The Services are provided for your personal, consumer use only unless otherwise specified, and are not intended for commercial or business use and such use is prohibited.

E-mail in inactive or terminated accounts may be deleted in accordance with United Online Web Servicesâ€™ policies.  United Online Web Services uses a variety of techniques to eliminate e-mail or attachments that United Online Web Services believes are unsolicited, inappropriate or harmful.  In doing so, United Online Web Services may block or delete e-mail or attachments sent by you or to you (including e-mail and attachments stored in your mailbox or a user-created folder), even though such e-mail or attachments may not be unsolicited, inappropriate or harmful.  You agree that United Online Web Services is not responsible for any e-mail or attachments that are blocked or deleted for any reason and that you have no right, and United Online Web Services has no obligation, to retrieve or access any such deleted or blocked e-mail or attachments.  You understand that unless otherwise specified in your service level or plan terms, United Online Web Services does not utilize anti-virus software or services to scan for viruses.  If your service level or plan terms include anti-virus software or services, you understand that not all viruses can be detected and/or cleaned.  You are responsible for any damages caused by your decision to download any e-mail or attachments.
  <p><b>Domain and Web Hosting Limitations.</b> United Online Web Services owns all domain names (unless you purchased the complete rights to the entire domain name) and websites, including the address for your personal website, provided to you by United Online Web Services unless otherwise specified.  You understand and agree that all content, including but not limited to, text, software, sound, images, communications and videos, provided by you is the sole responsibility of you, and United Online Web Services is not responsible and has no liability for any content contained on your site.

United Online Web Services may terminate any domain or web page for any reason with or without notice.   FTP access may be offered for the sole purpose of uploading, maintaining and downloading content for backup purposes only and not for the distribution of files.  Usage for webcam purposes must be limited to uploading once per every 30 seconds.   United Online Web Services retains the right to terminate or restrict any FTP access and/or remove any web site for improper or excessive FTP usage.  United Online Web Services may delete any free or advertising supported account including, without limitation, content, domain names and email, if such account is inactive for a period of 60 days or more.
